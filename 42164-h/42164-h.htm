<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In our busy and material lives we all need to be reminded
at times that there have been and still are
among us those who have deadened love of self, whose
struggle on earth, far from being to amass any kind of
treasures, is to bring before as many human beings as
possible the great plan of salvation, the means of elevation
from degradation to lofty Christian individuality,
and the source of a power and a love which are making
all things new in proportion as submission is given
thereto.</p>

<p>We are not always conscious of the strength exerted
around us by seemingly trivial forces, but their work
is no less important in the development of the globe
than the violent upheavals which overawe us by their
stupendous might. So, often, quiet lives extend a wider
permanent influence for the welfare of man than do
those of men and women who receive the unstinted
praise of their contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eli</span> and <span class="smcap">Sybil Jones</span> have done valuable service, and
have lived lives full of teaching to those who wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
enter upon a course of devoted obedience to the same
Master. I have prepared this sketch of their lives and
work from the love which I feel for them, and in the
hope that it will interest and profit others. I am conscious
that the stamp of youth is on the work, but I am
certain that it has been undertaken and accomplished
in the spirit of sincerity.</p>

<p>The visit to Liberia was wonderful in many ways,
and should have been published after their return, so
that their work might have brought forth more decided
fruit. The letters from Palestine and Syria were written
for the <cite>Friends' Review</cite> by Eli Jones and Ellen Clare
Miller (since Pearson). Extracts have been chosen
to give their descriptions of the country and the
nature of their work there.</p>

<p>The book has been prepared in the midst of other
work, and that must in part be the apology for its imperfections.
Having as a young man received invaluable
help from these two Friends, and feeling that their words
and lives have done much to throw light on the true
path which broadens into the "highway of holiness,"
it is my hope that this simple recital may in a measure
repay what I owe them and find a place of usefulness
in the world.</p>

<h3><em>EARLY YEARS.</em></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">"Man is the nobler growth our soil supplies,</div>
<div class="line">And souls are ripened 'neath our northern skies."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The man whose early life was passed in the isolation
of primeval forests, and who grew to manhood
carrying on an unceasing struggle to turn the rough,
uncultivated soil into productive fields, gardens, and
pasture-lands, has worked into his life something
which no coming generation can inherit or acquire.
He has missed the broad culture of the schools and
universities, he cannot gain the intellectual skill which
long study gives, but he has had a training which
lays a foundation for the keenest judgment and for
prompt decision in complicated circumstances, and
his soul in solitude has taken in truths of God which
often escape men lost in the tumultuous world of business
and pleasure. The men who were born during
the first quarter of a century after our national life
began have nearly all been characterized by special
traits which will perhaps not appear again in the
more developed growth of the nation. It has not
astonished us to see a man leave his little cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
after twenty-five years of toil and go through all the
grades of honor, reach a position from which he
could hardly go higher, and finally depart from a life
unspotted, respected by mankind.</p>

<p>But in this development there is no chance: he
mounts by a law which, if we knew it, is as unvariable
as that of gravitation. The powers of the mind and
soul seek a field in which they may be put to work at
profit. It cannot be uninteresting to follow the course
of a man who has shown&mdash;at least to those who have
known him well&mdash;that there was something in him of
value to the world. In measuring the worth of any
man, we must not be dazzled by the glare of earthly
glory, but calmly inquire what he has done that has
built itself into other lives, and we must look beyond
outward things to see in how far he has been the honored
tool of the Supreme Worker.</p>

<p>The family of Jones is a large one, and its genealogical
table would make a long story. Welsh John
succeeded Welsh John, and was called John's son until
time wore the name down to Jones. Generation after
generation they held their place and did their work
among the Welsh hills, until one of them was called
upon to steer the Mayflower with its precious load to
Plymouth. Eli Jones writes in a letter dated 1st mo.
9th, 1888: "I have been reading Bonvard's <cite>Plymouth
and the Pilgrims</cite>, from which I learn that Isaac Robinson,
son of the Rev. John Robinson, pastor of the
Pilgrim Fathers, was an early settler at Plymouth, and
that he became a Quaker. Our grandmother Jepson
was a Robinson, and, for aught I know, great-great-great-grandniece
of this very Isaac Robinson. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
captain of the Mayflower was a Jones. With him we
claim kindred, and that claim is readily allowed. Now,
if our great-great-great-grandsire was the venerable
patriarch who led in prayer and gave the memorable
parting charge<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to the Pilgrims, and if his son, our
great-great-greatuncle, was, as history relates, a trading
man in the colony and a 'convinced Friend,' it is certainly
fitting that we should take a lively interest in
what occurred among our kin in 1620."</p>

<p>Much later, after many settlements in different parts
of New England had failed, and the Pilgrim and Puritan
colonies were in prosperous growth, three brothers
bearing the name of Jones came to this continent. One
of them found a forest home on the bank of the
Androscoggin River, six miles from Brunswick, in the
township of Durham and District of Maine. Quite a
large number of friends collected here, and a meeting-house
was built not far away. There was a large
Friends' meeting at Deering, near Portland, and the
name of Jones was common among its members. The
monthly and quarterly meetings at each place were
frequently visited by Friends from the other, necessitating
a foot-journey of fully forty miles through almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
pathless woods. The house is still standing in which
Abel Jones was born. He determined to leave his
home and go farther north. He travelled on horseback
up the Kennebec River as far as Vassalboro', and then
rode ten miles east to the north-eastern end of what is now
China Lake, in earlier times often called the "Twelve-mile
Pond," because it is twelve miles from Augusta,
the State capital. His young bride, Susannah Jepson,
rode on horseback from North Berwick, a distance of
one hundred and fifteen miles. She was attended by
her brother alone, and brought only what a pair of
saddlebags could hold. Here in a little house, in the
year 1807, their first child was born and named Eli.
A letter was at once sent to the young child's grandfather
and grandmother at Durham. The letter came
to the nearest post-station, twelve miles away, and was
taken in charge by an elderly Friend who lived there.
He volunteered to start out at once to carry the letter
to its destination, thinking it might contain valuable
information. As he listened to its contents at the end
of his journey he made the significant remark, "Is that
all there is in it?" and jogged back home.</p>

<p>One's first thought would be that if a child was to be
brought up in the Maine woods, it would make very
little difference in what part of the State the spot happened
to be; but it is not at all so. As a young life is
very susceptible to outward scenes and every-day
events, we can hardly estimate the moulding influence
of little things.</p>

<p>The life of the few families in the early history of
China would be exceedingly interesting if we only had
a graphic sketch from the pen of one of its settlers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Owning the acres they cleared and tilled and the houses
in which they dwelt, they called no man master, but
they bowed in reverence before their heavenly King
and obeyed His commandments. They did their day's
work week after week, little thinking that a generation
would come which would wish to follow the story of
their trials and triumphs, their joys and sorrows; and
now almost all that is left us is the inherited strength
from their sturdy lives and a few stories of their sufferings.</p>

<p>Without doubt, nothing in nature had more influence
on the bent of Eli Jones's mind than China Lake and
its beautiful shores. A boy placed on the bank of a
lake stretching off seven miles becomes inheritor to a
domain more vast than the acres of water it contains.
He feels that he owns so much of this world's glory,
and this feeling of ownership lifts him out of the common,
dull round of life. Year by year he owns more
in proportion as his soul expands and he sees more
of God's work and God's love in the painted sunsets
beyond the western shore and in the forests above and
below the placid waters. No one who has not experienced
it can appreciate the worth of a lake to a boy.
It is not simply because he can fish there, or can swim
there, or can make a rude boat and so float on its surface.
That is its chief worth to the thoughtless boy,
but it was not all to the keenly perceptive child who
was father to the man Eli Jones. It was his great playmate
whom he loved. It was at the same time his
teacher, whose "various language" spoke a Father's
presence and His love.</p>

<p>It is very monotonous toil changing a rough forest
to a productive farm, but a youth becomes a familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
friend to stumps, hillocks, and rocks; to him the mounds
are Indian graves, the tall stones mark the final resting-places
of mighty chiefs, and his imagination fills the
round of work with marvellous scenes. Very many,
doubtless, see only their work and the fruit of it, but
there are a few who see mysteries and learn lessons
wherever they are placed, so that monotony is changed
to endless variety. Eli Jones was one of those boys
who make gain from ethereal things.</p>

<p>The spot which Abel Jones chose for his home had
many of the characteristics of a scene in Maine. Hills
were backed by other hills, and not far in from the lake
was a mile-long "horseback."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The trees were not
pigmies in those days, but giant oaks and pines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">"Whose living towers the years conspired to build,</div>
<div class="line">Whose giddy tops the morning loved to gild."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There were dense forests of cedar, and the scattered
bass-woods made the whole place fragrant in the spring.
Never had an axe swung in these solitudes, and the
mighty power of the ages was felt as these stout pines
met the breeze. It was no small privilege to be canopied
with such a tent as their meeting tops made.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Whoso walks in solitude</div>

<p>China had first been settled in 1774 by a family of
Clarks. There were four brothers, two of whom were
Friends. They cut the first tree that a white man's
axe had ever felled in the township, and began to survey
the land for homes. The two Friends chose the
eastern and the others the western side of the lake.
Life in the midst of the Maine forest implied struggle,
and these families were courageous. No report of
possible gold-mines or other hidden wealth drew them
and those who followed them, but the desire to seek
out quiet homes for themselves and their children
where the temptations to a life of uselessness would be
few. Trials they expected, and they were not spared.
It was a hand-to-hand contest with want. At one time
a cow was nearly the only valuable possession of the
little company, and this was accidentally shot for a deer.
The men went often ten miles through the woods, by
the aid of "spotted" or "blazed" trees, to get their corn
ground. We are told that in one case the mother
was forced to put stones, in lieu of potatoes, in the hot
ashes to induce her crying hungry children to go to
bed until they should be called, and often the potatoes
which had been planted were dug up to be eaten.
Indians and the wild animals were around them, continually
causing fear. In a cove at the south-western
shore of the lake is a large heart, called the "Indian's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
heart," cut in a huge boulder, and in spring nearly
covered by water. This marks the encampment of a
tribe of Indians naturally friendly to their white neighbors,
but exceedingly treacherous. On one occasion
they visited the settlers in a body, and while the latter
were unsuspiciously entertaining them they threw
water on the guns of the white men, and only the
darkness of the night saved these from destruction.</p>

<p>Gradually one family after another was added to the
community, and as they all came for the same purpose,
the settlement was composed of strong characters.
These farmers had the idea that it should not be the
chief aim of those who till the soil to grow rich, or to
fill the market with choice vegetables, or to gain an
easy livelihood, but rather to send out from their households
sons and daughters marked by strength of character
and able to do manly and womanly work in
the various spheres of the world. Their visible workfield
may have seemed narrow and roughly hedged in,
but they felt the needs of the future, and did their best
to raise a tower of strength in the land by properly
training their successors. The horizon which shuts in
their real domain expands as the times grow riper.</p>

<p>The first Friends' meeting in China was held about
1803, in a private house two and a half miles from
the south end of the lake. Abel Jones was married
to Susannah Jepson in this house in 1806, and
about seven years later a meeting-house was built, to
which Eli was taken even before it was wholly finished.
This building was heated by a wood-fire under an iron
kettle, and in every particular it was plain and rough;
but no more sincere praises to the Lord have risen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
through the arches of marvellously wrought cathedrals
than in this forest meeting-house. Eli Jones's grandfather
on his mother's side was the first acknowledged
minister in this meeting. Eli first heard the gospel
preached in this house, and here he saw the occasional
visitors from afar. Each year, which added its natural
increase to the boy's stature, was marking a no less
evident growth of mind and vigor of spirit. His
mother taught him that "serving God and keeping His
commandments was the whole duty of man." He was
shown by the quiet example of both parents that
honest work in the right spirit is an essential part of
pure and undefiled religion, while the lives of Joseph,
Samuel, David, and Daniel were put before him, showing
him the justness of God's dealing in the different
ages, both in rewarding righteousness and in punishing
unrighteousness. Those heroes of faith of the Old
Testament made a deep impression on him, as they
must on every young person whose mind is not corrupted
by the unnatural and impossible fictions of the
present day; but the pages which told of Christ's work
and words, His life and death, were so fixed in his
mind and heart that the great Master early began to
shape and strengthen the character of His chosen
disciple.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The opportunities for study in China were not enough
to satisfy a boy with even a moderately strong desire
for knowledge. Books were as rare as in the days
before John Gutenberg, and Eli Jones has often said
that if he had been asked ten times a day what he most
wished for, he would have answered each time, Books.
The fact that he longed so to read, and that he was
almost entirely confined to the Bible, resulted in his
becoming thoroughly familiar with the different parts
of that great Book. It furnished him his poetry, his
history, and his ethics; it was his reading-book and
his spelling-book. Joseph in his coat of many colors
and David with his sling were as much acquaintances
of his as were the few boys he played with. David's
lament for Jonathan and Deborah's song of triumph,
the spiritual melody of the Psalms and Isaiah's
rapt words, made him feel the power of Hebrew
poetry, while the New Testament was helping him to
know the manliness and divinity of Christ. What
boys acquired in those days was well acquired, and if
they did not have as much learning, they often were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
imbued with a better learning than at the end of the
same century. It is certain that Eli had the spirit to
learn, and did what he could to lay a proper foundation.</p>

<p>While he was still very young he came with his
father and mother to live at the south end of the lake,
and there was built the house which has been the birthplace
and home of so many of the Jones family. During
the years of political excitement and fierce war
against the mother-country&mdash;the years between 1812
and 1815&mdash;hardly a rumor of the outside strife had
penetrated the long line of unbroken forests. While
men were dying daily to force England to respect
American rights, and while Europe was united to
crush Napoleon, the citizens along China Lake were
building brick-kilns to make material for the chimneys
of their houses, doing their every-day work without
knowing, perhaps, that Bonaparte was in the world, and
having no fear that a war-cloud might break over them.
Thus the future lover of peace dwelt in peace, and he
did not need to learn the horrors of war by experience
to hate it.</p>

<p>A schoolhouse was built just over the hill north of
his home, and thither he went to be taught; but the
terms were very short, and the teachers only knew a
few first principles, though they faithfully labored to fix
these in the minds of their pupils. One teacher, after
working two days on a problem in long division, gave
the result to Eli Jones, saying, "I know that is right now,
but I can't explain it to you or tell you why it is done
that way." Eli had an exalted opinion of one of the
teachers who held sway in this little house, and has
often spoken of him with affection. He spent a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
winter teaching his older pupils to spell ordinary
English words correctly, and took Eli through the
spelling-book until all the words in it were fixed visibly
in his brain, where they have since remained; and in
all his teaching since spelling has been one of the
branches which was not elective in the course.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1827 he had the benefit of the
charitable fund at the Friends' School in Providence,
R. I. He divided the half year with another scholar, so
that he had only three months, but he was prepared to
make the most of this opportunity. He took ship-passage
from Bath to Providence. The first night after
his departure from home his mother passed in walking
the floor and worrying for her boy tossed on the sea, as
she supposed, but he was quietly sleeping all the while
in his berth on the ship, which had anchored in the
harbor on account of fog, and sailed the next morning.</p>

<p>Friends' School, which had been opened at Portsmouth
in 1784, was in its second organization less than
ten years old when he came to it, but it was firmly
established, and was often visited by its foster-father,
the venerable Moses Brown. The institution consisted
of one tall, massive brick building looking toward
the south, and two lower transverse wings, to which
successive additions have been made to meet the
needs of the times. In front and rear of the buildings
were extensive grounds divided into yards, lawns,
and groves of oak and chestnut trees, then in their
youth, now majestic with the increase of half a century.
Beyond the boundary of the school property,
toward the river which Roger Williams had crossed in
his search for a peaceful abode, were great forests of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ancient maples, oaks, and chestnuts, with hillsides of
towering hemlocks, and swamps where the boys, who
did not study botany, sought for little beyond the
extermination of a marvellous race of black snakes.
From the cupola of the middle building was a prospect
of wide extent, showing to the new-comers the whole
State at a glance, and placing before their eyes the
waters of Narragansett Bay.</p>

<p>Enoch Breed&mdash;called universally "Cousin Enoch"&mdash;was
at the head of the school as superintendent, while
his wife, "Cousin Lydia," was the matron. She was
a sweet, lovely lady, and her presence was felt by all
in the school. "Cousin Enoch" was not an educator,
but he was a kind, fatherly man, a shrewd manager, a
good farmer, and an exemplary character. He always
wore his broad-brimmed hat, and was never seen outside
of his private room with it off; the boys looked upon
him as their patriarch, and, indeed, it is said that on
one occasion he was asked if he were Methuselah, and
dryly answered, "No, I am Enoch."</p>

<p>Isaiah Jones taught the mathematics, and was considered
a very successful teacher. The other instructors
were David Daniels, who taught what Latin was
then required; George Jones, Moses Mitchel, Abigail
Pierce, and Mary Almy.</p>

<p>Reading, spelling, and grammar were the only classes
which recited; all the other work of the school was
done privately, each student being independent and
going as slowly or rapidly as his brain-power and
ambition prescribed. Mathematics was the important
branch, and each boy copied problems and their solutions
into interminable copy-books. The school-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was small and lighted by tin oil lamps on the desks.
In this room there were often one hundred and fifty
boys: a number of these were appointed as monitors
to report all disorderly conduct to the teachers.</p>

<p>The meetings were held in the building in an upper
chamber, where boys and girls and teachers sat in the
same room. These were generally silent meetings,
but occasionally William Almy or Doctor Tobey came
to give them counsel.</p>

<p>Among the schoolmates of Eli Jones were James N.
Buffum, since ex-mayor of Lynn, Mass., and Peter Neal,
also since ex-mayor of the same city, now on the committee
of the school. The latter relates that Eli Jones
received the "christening" always given new boys in
those days, and his remark on that occasion was characteristic
of him. The old students were put in line at
night on the play-ground, and among them stood the
newcomer. A "dummy" with swollen cheeks came to
each boy in turn, and was answered by all, "Um!"
until he reached Eli, who, as instructed beforehand,
said, "Squirt," when suddenly his face was filled
with water. Instead of the attack which the boys
expected, Eli quietly remarked, "<em>That was cleverly
done</em>." Peter Neal remarks that if he had been known
as he was a month later, he would have received no
christening.</p>

<p>His schoolmates relate that he was a good boy, and
that he was generally liked. In his youth he was
much troubled by an impediment in his speech, and
he early resolved to remedy it as much as possible.
He was the only one of scholars or teachers in the
boarding-school who was accustomed to speak in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Friends' meeting. He had already begun to speak at
home, and, notwithstanding the trial which it was to
him as a young man, he stood up among the boys and
forced his voice to say what was in his heart. Few
who heard him on those occasions are alive now, but
these few remember how it impressed them to see one
who played with them on the campus and sat with them
in classes speak so earnestly before them and all the
rows of solemn Friends. They respected his message,
for his life was pure.</p>

<p>He had a dread of the nursery, and resolved to keep
out of it, but he was taken with typhoid fever, and
after vainly fighting it off at last succumbed to be
doctored in the vigorous way of those times. He had
a long, hard siege of it, and lost a number of weeks
from his brief term; but this short break from his
usual life and the intercourse with cultivated teachers
and scholars could not fail to leave its impress. It
lifted his aspirations and widened somewhat the course
of his thoughts, giving an impulse to his future life
more valuable than mere knowledge. While it is to
be regretted that so short a time was given him for satisfying
his longings for a higher education, we rejoice
that he knew so well how to school himself and to be
a teacher to himself. He was a good mathematician,
and his copy-books show that he was no tyro at figures;
but he affirms that his drill in the old spelling-book
was of far greater worth to him than his higher mathematics.</p>

<p>When he reached home from Providence, he found
a young brother twenty-one years younger than himself.
This was Edwin, the youngest of the family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
eleven, and to him fell the homestead and the care of
the father, mother, and sister Peace.</p>

<p>There is still standing a little red building, about one
mile from South China, called the Chadwick Schoolhouse,
in which many a man has laid his ABC foundation.
Its external and internal appearance would not
lead one to suppose that this was a "temple of learning"
or any other kind of a temple, but not a few
successful men look back to it with a feeling of reverence,
and the near presence of a yard where many
others of its day tenants of earlier time lie under toppling
stones, just carved enough to tell the names and some
of the virtues of those beneath, gives somewhat of a
sacredness to the little building. It was in this house
that Eli first opened his mouth to speak in the assemblies
of the people. He was quite young, less than
fourteen, when he arose in a meeting in that house and
said, "Behold the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to
meet him." On their way home his grandfather asked
who had spoken in the "body of the meeting," but the
grandmother checked her husband with a slight nudge
and answered the question by a motion of her finger.
A few years ago a very aged man came up to Eli Jones
and said, "I remember the first time you ever spoke in
meeting, and I know what you said." From this time
on he was often heard briefly in religious assemblies,
and he was encouraged by older Friends to be faithful
in delivering his message when impressed.</p>

<p>After his return from Providence School, Eli Jones
began to be a definite worker for the bettering of the
world, and the seeds he then planted have brought
forth the blade and the ear, and now the full corn is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the ear. He and a few others organized a temperance
society of which he was the secretary; and many
meetings were held in China and the adjoining town.
Essays were written and speeches were delivered
against the use of intoxicating drinks. This organization
was made two years before the Washingtonian
movement was started, and its influence in the State
was great, aiding undoubtedly the enactment of the
"Maine Law" which has made itself felt in all our
States and in many of the other countries.</p>

<p>The same winter he was one of a small company
which met to start a public library. They formed a
successful library association. Books soon began to
come in, and from that day Eli Jones has not wanted
for reading matter. With few exceptions, when absent
doing higher work, he has attended the meetings of
this association and aided it by his zeal and counsel.</p>

<p>It is a matter of interest to notice a young man who
had just barely become a full-fledged citizen turning
his mind so strongly toward enlightening those near
him, and that, too, in a community where he did not
have the example of any predecessor to arouse him and
spur him on. He was travelling a new road, and building
as he went. The secret of it all was that there
was something in him which forbade rest and inaction.
In early years he saw fully that the part of man which
ate and slept was not the important part, but that there
was something within him which could span space and
time, and which was spoken to by the whisperings of
the Spirit of the eternal Ruler.</p>

<p>At the present time biographies are within the reach
of all boys, and they can see how great men and good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
men have made their lives complete&mdash;how they shaped
their course, what goal they set before them, and what
lifted them to the mark. In his youth, Eli Jones had
almost no possibility of knowing from the record of
other lives how best to build in youth. His father was
a righteous man, whose actions were living epistles, and
his mother was a living, teaching Christian. From
both he inherited much and learned much; but "there
is a divinity that shapes our ends," and, once in the
hands of the great Potter, there is a marvellous shaping
of the clay. Biographies, all good books, and directions
in the right way are helps, but submission to be
trained and then used by the Master Builder, is infinitely
more of a help in the making of a right man.</p>

<p>Great men of all ages have recognized a power, a
daimon, an ecstasy&mdash;or, better, a Spirit&mdash;inspiring them,
urging them to seek truth and beauty, to live lives of
truth and beauty and goodness, and to shun as their
greatest enemy everything that distorts and ties weights
to their flying feet. Everything teaches the man who
is to be wise; but most of all the Spirit teaches those
who give ear unto Him; and if any one thing has
made the life of Eli Jones a success, it is that he
listened actively to the voice which said, "Give me
thine heart."</p>

<h3><em>MARRIAGE WITH SYBIL JONES.</em></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"I see in the world the intellect of man,</div>
<div class="line">That sword, the energy his subtle spear,</div>
<div class="line">The knowledge which defends him like a shield&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Everywhere; but they make not up, I think,</div>
<div class="line">The marvel of a soul like thine."</div>
<div class="line indent8"><span class="smcap">Browning.</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>In 1833, Eli Jones was married to Sybil Jones, the
daughter of Ephraim and Susannah Jones.</p>

<p>Susannah was the daughter of Micajah Dudley, son
of Samuel Dudley, a great-grandson of Samuel Dudley
of Exeter, N. H., the eldest son of Gov. Thomas Dudley,
the pilgrim of Plymouth, said to have been descended
from the lineage of the earls of Leicester.
Both Sybil Jones's parents and grandparents were
Friends, and her grandfather and great-grandfather
Dudley were preachers of fine talents and high
character.</p>

<p>Ephraim Jones was a "noble man" and a strong
character. He was often deeply lost in thought, to
such an extent that many anecdotes are related of
his absent-mindedness which are very amusing. He
did not want in vigor of mind, and he was one of the
marked men of the town. Some are still alive who
remember him as he stood up at quarterly meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and took his text, "If thou hast run with the footmen,
and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou
contend with horses? and if in the land of peace,
wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how
wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?" He was a
man who left a remembrance behind him, and the
strength of his life has not been lost. His wife Susannah
lived to the good old age of ninety-four, and
was loved by all who saw her. "Grandmother Jewel"
was her name in her old age. Eli's mother, who was
nearly as old, was also named Susannah, and it was a
memorable day for the grandchildren when these two
grandmothers talked together of the olden time.
"Grandmother Jewel" was very deaf, but otherwise
she was a vigorous woman as long as she lived, and,
ripe with years and blessed with the fruit of those
years, she passed from this world a few months before
her daughter.</p>

<p>It is told that when Eli Jones visited Sybil Jones
with the purpose of asking her to become his life-companion,
the latter, not suspecting the weight of his
mission, took down the Bible to read a chapter, as was
always customary in those days before visitors returned
home. On this occasion Sybil Jones opened to the
twentieth Psalm, beginning, "The Lord hear thee in
the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob
defend thee, send thee help from the sanctuary and
strengthen thee out of Zion; remember all thy offerings
and accept all thy burnt-sacrifices; grant thee according
to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel." The
mission was accomplished successfully, and for forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
years the lives of Eli and Sybil Jones were linked
together by the bonds of deep and pure love, while
their aims, longings, and desires were merged into the
one purpose of showing to the world that there is a
love which transcends all earthly affection, and that
God's love is an unbroken canopy which shelters the
races of the round globe. Herein was their love continually
made more perfect. I may quote as applicable
to them the beautiful words of Izaak Walton, written
to express the regard between the saintly George
Herbert and his wife: "For the eternal Lover of mankind
made them happy in each other's mutual and
equal affections and compliance; indeed, so happy
that there never was any opposition betwixt them,
unless it were a contest which should most incline
to a compliance with the other's desires. And though
this begot, and continued in them, such a mutual love
and joy and content as was no way defective, yet this
mutual content and love and joy did receive a daily
augumentation by such daily obligingness to each
other as still added such new affluences to the former
fulness of these divine souls as was only improvable
in heaven."</p>

<p>Sybil Jones was born at Brunswick, Me., in 1808.
Her birthplace was very near the early home of Abel
Jones. Only her youngest years were spent here, but
she always had a love for her first home, and one of her
early poems, written at about the age of twenty-one,
speaks of it with fondness.</p>

<p>Her early life was spent at Augusta, "which was the
birthplace of those deep religious impressions that
formed the motive power of a life pre-eminently consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to the service of her Redeemer and the
human race." She often felt that the sermons and
exhortations to which she listened during her early
years were not of such a nature as to bring her to a
saving knowledge of the sacrifice and love of Christ.
Perhaps too little care was taken in those days to fulfil
the Lord's command, "Feed my lambs;" and it is possible
that our Society would have been more strongly
built up if those good men who preached zealously to
<em>edify</em> the <em>Church</em> had done so more effectually by taking
the little ones by the hand and pointing them to the
Source of satisfying life.</p>

<p>A good Methodist minister at Augusta spoke kindly
to Sybil Jones of her highest welfare, and she was
very much helped and instructed by him in the way
of life. She came to realize that she must be born
again, and she accepted Christ, by whom alone she
could become a child of God. Her love for the
Methodists became very strong, and it was a most
humiliating cross to her to obey her father's will that
she should show her Quakerism by wearing a Friend's
plain bonnet. There is a true anecdote which may
properly be told, since it shows what her will was by
nature, as we shall see later what power she had
when it was in harmony with God's will. She was to
attend China monthly meeting with her father, and he
insisted that she should wear the "plain" bonnet. His
request conflicted very much with her determination,
but it was not possible to move him from his purpose.
There was no course which could be taken to avoid
wearing it, but she put it on bottom side up, and rode
with it so from Augusta to China. But she fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
saw and felt the simplicity and sincerity of Friends, as
well as the spirituality of their faith, and she became
firmly fixed in the belief that to be a true Quaker was
to be a genuine Christian, a faithful follower of Jesus
as he and his apostles marked out the road; and I
must believe that if we all looked to the same source
for light and guidance, and if we strove as earnestly to
walk closely in His footsteps as she did, we should
have little need of apologies and defences for our
simple faith.</p>

<p>In 1824-25 she attended the Friends' School at
Providence, and for the next eight years she was
engaged in teaching. She felt a deep interest in all
that concerned her pupils, and it was the beginning
of her efforts to open to the eyes of the young a new
world of knowledge, beauty, and truth. One who has
taught with a heart in the work will never cease to
look upon children with loving eyes; and they were
always the especial objects of her regard irrespective
of their race or color.</p>

<p>While still a teacher her father took her one day
to attend Sidney monthly meeting, across the Kennebec
River, about twelve miles from China. Lindley
M. Hoag, then a young man, was at the meeting. He
felt called to deliver a message to some one in the
women's meeting, and an opportunity was given him
to accomplish his purpose. He went to the women's
side of the house and powerfully and clearly set forth
the state of mind of some one present, and with prophetic
words he pointed out the future course of this
young Friend if she should be fully faithful to her
inward promptings. Sybil Jones knew that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
laying open her heart, and she was much moved.
When her gift as a minister was acknowledged, and
she went out to hold meetings, she found Lindley Hoag
present at the first one she attended, and for some time
it seemed to her that she could not speak before him;
but she overcame the feeling and was well favored to
speak. This guidance from ministers who were moved
to speak to her case, and the power given to her to
declare the condition of others, were strikingly illustrated
during her whole life.</p>

<p>During these years of teaching she was much given
to writing, and she not only copied many of the poems
of her favorite authors, but she composed numerous
poems on various subjects, and wrote short maxims
for the rule of her conduct and life. It is very striking
and touching to see how she regarded the brevity
of life, for almost all that is left of her compositions
is tinged with thoughts of death and the grave. One
poem is written "To Consumption," and she seems
to have been impressed with the feeling that her days
were to be few, but she hails with joy the beginning
of another life and the freedom from the cares and
troubles of this present world. After saying how soon
"life's sickly dream" will be over she writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Oh may my future hours be given</div>
<div class="line">To peace, to virtue, and to Heaven,</div>
<div class="line">My hopes retain immortal birth,</div>
<div class="line">My joys ascend above the earth,</div>
<div class="line">My steps retrace the path they trod,</div>
<div class="line">My heart be fixed alone on God!"</div>
</div></div>

<p>While still young she burned most of her prose and
poetic compositions, partly because she was so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
forced to read them aloud to company, and very little
from those years remains.</p>

<p>The following short poem may be as interesting as
any, as her early wish here expressed was so perfectly
fulfilled in the character of her accepted life-companion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"What! shall a face, then, win my heart,</div>
<div class="line indent2">Mere symmetry of form?</div>
<div class="line">Such thrilling raptures <em>this</em> impart</div>
<div class="line indent2">With <em>love my bosom</em> warm?</div>
<div class="line">As well might ocean's billow heave</div>
<div class="line indent2">When not a wind did rise,</div>
<div class="line">As Fancy thus my heart deceive</div>
<div class="line indent2">And fix my wandering eyes,</div>
<div class="line">No; 'tis the beauty of the soul</div>
<div class="line indent2">That could my bosom fire;</div>
<div class="line">This would my tenderest thought control,</div>
<div class="line indent2">And love and truth inspire."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The thoughts expressed in some of her maxims
show the bent of her mind, whether they are original
or not. For example: "If you are told that another
reviles you, do not go about to vindicate yourself,
but reply thus: My other faults, I find, are hid
from him, else I should have heard of them too;"
"Fix your character and keep to it, whether alone or
in company;" "No man can hurt you unless you
please to let him; then only are you hurt when you
think yourself so."</p>

<p>Whatever her early attempts may show, Sybil Jones
was certainly of a highly poetic nature. Her whole
organism was so delicate that musical tones proceeded
from her at the slightest touches from within or without.
Melodious words came almost unsummoned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
her lips as she plead with sinners to come to the
waters of life and "drink without money and without
price." John Bright told the present writer that it was
always a delight to him to listen to her, and that he
regarded her as a poet of high degree in her thought
and expression.</p>

<p>So with her daily duties and her thoughts of life and
the future she developed from girlhood to womanhood,
and at the age of twenty-five became the wife of Eli
Jones. The joy and fruit resulting from their union
show unmistakably how fully they were suited for
each other, and they gave each other mutual help and
inspiration. Their married life was begun at South
China upon a farm which has since been divided into
a number of smaller ones. The young wife was very
careful in her expenditures, and an accurate account
of all their expenses and their income was minutely
kept by her.</p>

<p>The Friends' meeting-house was three miles away at
Dirigo. Thither they rode through the long, quiet
woods every First and Fifth day to take their places
among the rows of Friends waiting upon the Lord. Few
houses made with hands have received more devoted
worshippers, and few places have been more hallowed
by the presence of pure souls met with one purpose,
that of honoring the Ruler of the universe and learning
from His Holy Spirit. Here, in the presence of sympathizing
listeners, the voices of these two young Friends
were often heard, and they were early enrolled among
the ministers of the Society. The phrase of the early
Friends was truly fitting in their case: "Their gifts
were acknowledged." The men and women of China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
meeting made it their greatest endeavor to serve God
acceptably in the path of daily duty and self-denial.
One by one their beautiful lives have ended; happily,
a few of them are yet left as examples, but a Quakerism&mdash;or
rather a Christianity&mdash;which could round and
perfect such characters had no earthly origin. China
meeting at this time did not abound in powerful ministers,
but its members were men and women whose lives
were transparent and pure. They were "diligent in
business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord," and they
lived sermons. There has almost always been in this
community one or two Hymenæuses and Philetuses
who have drawn creeds for their private guidance and
who have severely troubled the Friends; but such disturbances
have generally resulted in the exaltation of
the true faith, and as in the natural world the struggle
to overcome hindrances to growth adds strength and
vigor, so a wolf in sheep's clothing within the fold increases
the vigilance of the spirit and the dependence
on the great Shepherd. There were many intricate
questions now and then arising for discussion which
gave valuable instruction to the young ministers, and
they were gradually being prepared for useful service.
Those of other denominations who know only of a
training in a theological seminary as a fitting for preaching
and teaching cannot understand how they were
being taught in this remote country village; but "by
the Spirit's finer ear" they were hearing truths of life
and immortality, and on the Rock they were building
characters of gold, silver, precious stones.</p>

<p>Eli Jones was a hard-working man, not only doing
his farm-work, but at different times owning shares in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
mills at Albion and in China and assisting in the work
of running them. After living a few years at South
China he removed to Dirigo and settled on a farm near
the Friends' meeting, where he lived until 1886.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Eli Jones was in London in 1875 he wrote to
Sarah Fobey, a lifelong friend of his beloved wife, for
her recollections of their school-days together, and her
thoughts as to Sybil Jones's spiritual exercises then
and since. She wrote from Montreux, Switzerland, as
follows:</p>

<p>"My mind is filled with sweet and precious memories
of the dear one. She and I met at Friends' School in
Providence in 1825. We met as strangers, but a feeling
of sympathy which is not easily explained soon drew
us together, and our intercourse there was the commencement
of one of the most delightful friendships
that in all this changing scene grew stronger and
brighter with every passing year. I remember her as
one of the most studious pupils in the school, always
coming to her class with her lessons fully prepared and
reciting them in a manner that gained the admiration
of her classmates. She had great love for the beautiful,
and a keen enjoyment of beautiful language whether
poetry or prose, and committing to memory, as she
did, with ease, her mind thus early became stored with
much that was an enjoyment to her in after years. In
our Scripture lessons we made our own selections,
hers were always the most beautiful portions of the
Bible, often from Isaiah and the Psalms, a long chapter
thoroughly committed to memory, and recited in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
manner which showed she appreciated the truths it
declared.</p>

<p>"To her schoolmates she was most kind and affectionate,
and by her readiness to assist them in their lessons
and in every way to do them good gained their universal
love and esteem.</p>

<p>"She had a great flow of animal spirits, and entered
with warmth and interest into all our innocent pleasures
and amusements; but such was her sense of justice and
of right that she would never overstep the bounds of
order nor disobey the regulations of the school. Of
her religious feeling and experience at that time I
cannot speak. It was not the custom then, as now in
our Society, to speak of conversion or to tell what God
had done for our souls; and I had supposed that it
was not until after her return home that she gave her
heart to Jesus and became fully and entirely a child of
His, ready to do His bidding, and desiring above every
other consideration to follow Him in the way of His
leading. How faithfully she did so, going from place
to place, from city to city, from State to State, finally
from continent to continent, declaring the unsearchable
riches of Christ! One of the most affectionate and loving
of mothers, she counted nothing too near or too dear
to part with for His blessed name's sake.</p>

<p>"How many sinners she has warned! how many
inquirers she has pointed to Jesus, the door of hope!
how many mourners she has comforted! She faithfully
obeyed the injunction, 'Sow ye beside all waters,'
and the seed thus sown has taken root, and will continue
to bear fruit long after we shall have gone to join
the dear ones who earlier than we have entered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their Master's rest. Who can calculate the amount of
good that one such life of dedication and devotion has
accomplished? It seems to me that a faithful record
of it should be an incentive to others to seek to follow
her as she followed Christ. To me she was the most
remarkable woman I have ever met, and I feel it to
have been a peculiar blessing to have known her so
long and loved her so well. Now, as I write, 'Memory
opens the long vista of buried years,' and my heart
travels through them all. I linger around sunny spots,
happy hours, days of delight, seasons of sweet spiritual
communion, in which she related to me the wonderful
dealings of her heavenly Father toward her, and the
remarkable manner in which she was often supplied
with means to accomplish the service she believed He
required of her&mdash;how when there seemed no way for
her to move He made a way.</p>

<p>"She always seemed to me to be so spiritually-minded,
and to live so near her Saviour, as to be led and guided
in a remarkable manner by Him. I remember her
when she opened her prospect to go to Europe for the
last time. She rises before me now, as she has often
done, as I saw her then. Soon after the meeting of
ministers and elders assembled Doctor Tobey arose
and said, 'If there is a subject of particular interest
and importance to come before the meeting, this
seems to be the proper time.'</p>

<p>"She had not expected to present it at that sitting,
but, as she afterward told me, she said to herself, 'That
surely means me.'</p>

<p>"She sat a little, while a feeling of great solemnity
overspread the meeting. She then arose with the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
beautiful and heavenly expression of countenance, her
whole soul filled with the engrossing subject, and with
a grace and elegance of manner of which she was
entirely unconscious told us in beautiful and touching
language what she felt called to do in the service of her
Lord, gratefully acknowledging His many mercies thus
far in her journey of life, and her unshaken confidence
and trust in Him for all that was to come. The meeting
was greatly moved and she was liberated with
entire unity.</p>

<p>"How lovely and sweet she was! and, though she
lived so many years and did so much good in them
all, it always seems to me that she died 'in the midst
of her years.'</p>

<p>"Oh, we should have liked to keep her longer, the
dear one! But He who seeth to the end knew when to
close the strife&mdash;</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1840, Sybil Jones was liberated
by her Friends to attend meetings and do religious
work in the provinces, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.
In this work she was attended by her husband,
and they passed through many trying circumstances;
but, being sustained from above, they came home
bringing sheaves with them and feeling that they had
been instruments in God's hand of doing good. A
brief account of this journey was kept by Sybil Jones.
It has never been published, but is full of interest
to all those who love to follow the steps of devoted
servants of the Lord.</p>

<p>During the first winter of the Revolutionary War,
Benedict Arnold and a band of soldiers forced their
way over almost insurmountable obstacles through
the Maine woods to capture Montreal, Quebec, and
the other Canadian strongholds. Historians have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
followed their track, carefully noting every detail of
their march, recording what they suffered and what
injuries they inflicted, and that, too, though the expedition
failed of its end and many a fair young life
was lost in vain. Certainly, we can well afford to
follow the pilgrimage of two soldiers of the cross fully
as heroic, carrying to those otherwise perishing the
news of life and salvation.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones was thirty-two years old when she made
this visit; she was in delicate health, and obliged to
leave her two young children, James Parnell and
Narcissa, behind; but her whole soul was in the
work, and she writes as she would have done when
years had fully developed her. In this and her other
diaries there often occur expressions which to the
frequent readers of Fox and the early missionary
Friends may sound stated and formal, but there is
a life pervading the whole which shows conclusively
to a thoughtful person that these phrases are not
forms, but words clearly expressive of what she felt
burning in her heart, and they add to rather than
detract from the weight of her account. There is a
wonderful depth of meaning and originality in the
expressions of Friends which unfortunately is lost
sight of by continual use, just as in all language
word-metaphors which subtly picture thoughts become
cold by use and lose their picturesqueness. In
reading the pages recording the earnest labors of long
ago let us read in them all that was put there by
looking for the feeling and life under the words:</p>

<p>"Left home with a certificate from some of my
friends to visit some of the British provinces, the 23d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of 8th mo., 1840, in company with my husband. He
also has a certificate for said service. Being disappointed
in a female companion, we had either to resign
the prospect of a visit this season or proceed with no
other company than our dear friend Daniel Smiley,
who, with a minute from his monthly meeting,
concluded to accompany us to Nova Scotia. It was
a trying case, but, feeling as though the present time
was the right time, we informed the committee appointed
by the monthly meeting for the purpose of
providing us with suitable company, how it was with
us. They met with the elders, and informed us of
their conclusion, which was that they thought best
for us to proceed if it seemed like the right time, as
we had informed them. We had to proceed on the
prospect of apprehended duty under discouraging
circumstances, yet I trust with a humble reliance on
Him who hath said, 'I will be a defence unto Israel.'
Being favored to resign ourselves to His direction and
protection, we felt our only strength to be in Him,
feeling, too, the consoling assurance that our dear
friends we have left behind will travail in exercises
with us for the Truth's honor and our preservation
from every hurtful thing. We leave our dear children
in the best place we could find.... Above all, we
have felt a humble trust that He who never slumbers
will keep them; and in remembrance of the blessed
promise, that all things shall work together for good
to them that love and fear God, I have been enabled
under multiplied discouragement to adopt the language,
'Thy will, not mine, be done.' Blessed be
His name for ever who has been with me in six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
troubles, and has given me assurance that He will
not forsake even in the seventh if my place is where
Mary's was of old.</p>

<p>"We attended two meetings the day we left&mdash;one in
Windsor, the other in Whitefield&mdash;which were very
trying meetings....</p>

<p>"<em>Second day, 31st.</em> Arrived at Joseph Ester's in
Calais; had a favored meeting this evening in the
Calvinist Baptist meeting-house. The people here
are so attached to Friends that they think it a privilege
to let us have a house for a meeting. The
Baptists claimed the privilege, and we thought best
to improve it. After meeting I took cold from the
damp air so frequent in this place, and was confined
to the house till 9th mo. 4th. Proceeded to an appointment
at St. Stephen's (English side), First day,
9th mo. 6th, at two <small>P. M.,</small> at the Methodist house,
which was a humbling season to the poor creatures,
but the eternal truth reigned over all, and I hope the
'blessed Master of assemblies' had the honor, for it
was by the might of His power that the tall cedars of
Lebanon bowed and the oaks of Bashan bent. Nothing
is too great for Him to do for us when our trust is
in Him. May it ever be placed there! Second day,
7th, had a meeting at St. Stephen's in a Baptist house;
put up at Ruggles's temperance house; felt quite
at home here; they were an interesting family. We
sat with the family before leaving them, and divine
ability was given to speak in the language of encouragement
to them, assuring them that a <em>little</em> with
the incomparable blessing of a peaceful mind was
better than hoards of gold obtained in a way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
injure our fellow-creatures. The demoralizing effects
of the sale and use of ardent spirits were lamentably
felt here. The landlord told us that he was once in
the habit of keeping them for travellers and others,
but became convinced that it was wrong. It brought
him into a close trial, he told us, for this was the chief
source of income. He said he prayed to his heavenly
Father to direct him what to do, and the answer was that
he must carry on the baking business. He accordingly
entered into it, and with the assistance of two or three
daughters he made a good income. Oh that all would go
and do likewise who are in this iniquitous practice, that
must surely prove, if persisted in, their condemnation!</p>

<p>"<em>8th.</em> Parted from several of our dear friends who
came to bid us farewell, and proceeded on our journey;
came about noon to Oak Bay, parish of St. David's, a
small village. Here we paused a little, but proceeded.
My mind became distressed for leaving the place without
trying to have a meeting, which I kept to myself
until we had travelled about two and a half miles, when
I was obliged to request our dear friend to turn about;
which was crossing to us all, feeling very anxious to get
along, having been detained from my ill-health, meetings,
etc. beyond our expectations. But on turning toward the
place I think we all participated in the reward of peace.
We stopped at William Josling's, who met us with tears
of joy. Oh may we omit nothing required of us, but
be willing to do and suffer His will who will do all
things well! This evening had a meeting in the Baptist
house. It was a solemn season, and to the honor
of truth, I trust. Lodged at William Golding's, who
was in a tried state of mind owing to entanglement with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the doctrine of predestination. He spoke of the circumstance
of Pharaoh where the Lord said, 'For this
same purpose I have raised thee up;' also named the
passage from the apostle, 'Hath not the potter power
over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel
for honor and another for dishonor?' He said that he
considered it as a temptation of the enemy, but at
times could hardly keep it out of his mind. As the
subjects opened to my mind I endeavored to explain
them.... He seemed satisfied, and said he had never
had so clear an explanation before. Not feeling clear
of the place without trying for another meeting, we
accepted the Methodist house, which was kindly offered.
A Universalist encountered me after meeting. I endeavored
to keep near best help. He became silent,
and I think the truth sank deep in his heart. We
parted in mutual love and good feeling. He was a
member of the legislative council, a man of talents.
We called on the Methodist minister and his wife, who
received us gladly; we thought them sincere-hearted
followers of Christ. Parted under a feeling of holy
relationship. Left this place for Tower Hill, in the
parish of St. David. Arrived in a lonely-looking place,
very desolate, where were a few inhabitants and a
schoolhouse. There are few here who reflect, I think,
that they must die, and that it is needful to prepare for
that solemn event. We left them under serious impression,
I think. We called on a woman apparently
dying, who said she was not prepared to die; her sins
were not forgiven. The family and several neighbors
present were in great distress. I felt moved to call her attention
to Jesus, who alone could help, reminding her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the penitent thief upon the cross. Surrounding beholders
were warned to seek the Lord while in health,
and not put it off till a dying bed, as the pains of the
feeble body were enough to bear, without the indescribable
pains of a wounded conscience. We called again
on the sick woman, who seemed a little revived. I
felt drawn to impart some words of encouragement,
also to supplicate our heavenly Father on behalf of
all present. My dear husband imparted some words
of encouragement to her. We then left her bedside,
where extreme poverty and want were strikingly apparent,
with some assurance that she would find forgiveness
and go in peace. We proceeded to meeting.
A large number of thoughtless mortals were assembled.
We had to travail in deep exercises for the awakening
of life. Dear husband supplicated for divine aid, which
was mercifully granted. Truth finally obtained the
victory. It is the Lord's doing and marvellous in
our eyes.</p>

<p>"<em>15th.</em> Had a meeting at Bearing in a schoolhouse
at the fourth hour, and one at Mehanas, parish of St
Stephen's, at seven&mdash;the last a truly contriting season.
I proceeded, accompanied by my dear husband, to visit
some public-houses and places where liquor is sold,
and to visit some serious people. This work of apprehended
duty was most humiliating to the poor creature,
but cheerful submission clothed my mind with sweet
peace. We were treated kindly by all, and all expressed
their thankfulness to us for calling, and received civilly
what we had to deliver to them, saying they knew the
right, but were unwilling to do it. Not feeling clear
of these parts without a meeting with the Congregationalists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
at Calais, though I thought it probable
that they would not grant it, I informed our company
of it, who encouraged me to attend to the opening.
Accordingly, a messenger was despatched, and returned
word that they were expecting to meet in the evening
for a prayer-meeting, and would cheerfully give up the
meeting to us without a single objection. The Lord
will make a way where there appears to be no way.
In the evening we met with them, and had a good
meeting, mutually satisfactory.</p>

<p>"<em>17th.</em> Sat down at the house where we were staying
with the family at meeting hour. Our little number
with the family were enough to inherit the Saviour's
blessed promise, 'There will I be in the midst of them.'
We gave no notice, but two or three neighbors somehow
got information and joined our company. At first
it was a stripped season. The cloud as big as a man's
hand was hardly discernible, but in the Lord's own
time He blessed us indeed. His power arose to the
contriting of all present. It was truly a refreshing
time, in which we could say, 'The Lord is my goodness
and fortress, my high tower.'</p>

<p>"<em>18th.</em> Had a meeting at the Ledge in St. Stephen's
at two o'clock. Some of the true wrestling seed were
present, who were visited in their low dwelling-place
and refreshed with the circulating influence of divine
love, which spread even to the skirts of the assembly.
I am ready to say, 'The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall
not want.' 'He brought me into his banqueting-house,
and his banner over us was love.'</p>

<p>"<em>26th, which was First day.</em> Had a meeting in the
city of St. John, in the Methodist chapel in Germania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
street, at 2 <small>P. M.</small>, and one at 6 o'clock in the parish of
Portland, in the Methodist house. Several thousand
souls met with us this day, and the Lord blessed us abundantly
to the refreshing of the weary traveller toward
the city of rest. Lodged at the Methodist preacher's,
William Temple, who was truly hospitable. On the
morning of the 28th went to the steamboat bound to
Annapolis, but, it being stormy, the captain deemed it
improper to put out to sea. Having our horses and
carriage put on board at high tide, and could not get
them off until tide served again, we felt some anxiety,
fearing we had not done right in this procedure, as the
elements seemed against us. We met with a man
named Abial L. Brown on board, who kindly asked us
to go home with him and remain until the boat should
go. We gladly accepted his invitation and went to the
house, where the family received us with affection, set
some refreshments before us, of which we gladly partook,
not having taken any breakfast and having walked
some distance in the wet and cold. After being thus
refreshed and having warmed ourselves, we felt inclined
to assemble the family for a religious opportunity, which
was gladly acceded to on their parts. The season was
a truly comforting one. Afterward we inquired for
a woman who had spoken to us the evening before
after meeting and manifested a great desire to have an
interview with us. From our description one of the
daughters kindly offered to try to find her, though they
could not tell her name. She made a successful attempt,
and soon came with Elizabeth Girard, as she said her
name was. She was a Friend in principle, though
belonging to the Methodists. She lamented much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
extravagant conformity to the vain fashions of the
world, which is at enmity to Christ&mdash;said they had
sorrowfully departed from the simplicity which marked
the members in their rise in Wesleyan days. She spoke
of the spiritual worship very clearly as that which was
alone acceptable unto God. The storm subsided at
about ten o'clock. We left, accompanied by E. G.,
who went to the steamboat with us. After our imparting
some advice to this dear friend, she left. At
about one o'clock we left St. John's City, and in twelve
hours were across the Bay of Fundy at Annapolis.
I was not very seasick; He who holdeth the waters in
His hand preserves us yet. Little vital religion is felt
in this part of the heritage. The people here have
many advantages for a livelihood. The land has a rich
soil, and the Annapolis River flowing through it in the
midst of an extensive valley, where many of its farms
stretch along its banks, the rich products may be
borne through the river into the Bay of Fundy to distant
parts. Thus was a kind Providence bountifully
blessed, but a worldly spirit is prevailing among them.</p>

<p>"<em>14th.</em> Held a meeting at Granville, and on the 15th
went over Young's Mountain. Again not feeling clear,
had a meeting in the evening, a memorable season of
humbling contrition to most present. A young man
named James Van Blarcum, being at this meeting, was
convinced of the truth. May the Lord give him strength
to suffer for His cause, which will no doubt be the case
if he proves faithful!"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>Eli and Sybil Jones attended many more meetings
in the provinces, among them Annapolis, Wilmot
Mount, Wolfville, Falmouth, Pictou, and Truro, making
many weary journeys, some days riding as much
as forty-three miles to hold a meeting. These long
rides were attended with many discomforts, as it was
the eleventh month, and the weather extremely raw and
cold. The roads were in poor condition, and the mud
oftentimes almost impassable. Sybil Jones describes
the difficulties encountered in making their way to
Truro: "Coming to two roads about noon, we inquired
of an innkeeper the direct road to our destination.
We followed his directions, found excellent
roads, but, being through a thick forest, it was rather
lonely. The weather being cloudy, night came on
early, without discovering any opening in the dense
forest that encompassed us. The thought did not
occur that we might be on the wrong road until the
horses began to wade very deep in mud. My husband
sprang out of the carriage to lead the horses. After
proceeding a few steps, the mire growing deeper, he
ordered the carriage stopped, and after travelling
around some time in the dark he exclaimed that we
were on the wrong road&mdash;that we had come to the
end of a road. Our feelings can better be imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
than described. Strangers in a strange land, in a vast
wilderness at the end of our road, and the night being
without even starlight, I shall never forget my feelings.
We found our carriage was fast in the mire. After
unharnessing the horses, which with some difficulty
leapt out on hard footing, the men soon pried the
carriage out and harnessed to return, while I stood
on a dry spot where my dear husband had placed me.
I was afraid that we had been directed there for a
wicked design, when these words came to me: 'Judah's
lion guards the way, and guides the traveller
home.' After going back about fifty rods we discovered
a light, and, going to it, found that it proceeded
from a little hut. The people said that we
could get across the woods, to the right road by going
a quarter of a mile, and kindly offered to go with
us and show us the way. We followed through the
roughest road I ever passed. One had to hold the
carriage behind to keep it from upsetting. We arrived
safe on the road, happy and thankful."</p>

<p>They had many "opportunities" in family circles,
which they always found refreshing. They met with
great kindness, although in many places they were
greatly grieved to find that the spirit of the world held
sway over the people. In many cases a great controlling
power was felt, and they left believers much
strengthened in the Lord to cope with the adversary.
Owing to the inclemency of the weather they deemed
it expedient to return to their homes. The homeward
journey was long, and they were often able to get but
scanty accommodations; but they ever found the "Lord
a covert from the storms," and proved Him to be "as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the shadow of a great rock in a weary land." They
were greatly cheered on retracing their steps to find
that the seed scattered on their journey of love had
fallen in good ground. The tavern-keeper with whom
they had labored so lovingly had given up his sinful
business, and was now keeping a strictly temperance
house. Indeed, there was now no rum sold in the
town. With deep interest and love for the dear people
in the field in which they labored, and looking to God
to bless their labors, they took their way to the home
where were the dear children whom to leave was so
hard.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of winter before they prepared
to return, so that it was impossible for them to use
the carriage with which they made the journey, and
it was finally decided to put the carriage on runners,
and in this way the long return journey was
made.</p>

<p>Some years later they went over the same ground
by carriage on a second visit to the provinces. In one
place, as they were driving along through a long wood,
they were met in the road by a huge bear, which stood
its ground for some time, but finally retreated and
allowed the Friends to go on their mission. Soon
after this visit Eli Jones felt that it was his duty to
go over the meetings of Canada and to speak to the
Friends there, both in the different assemblies and by
their firesides. His dear wife in the mean time was
making a tour through New England, doing the work
which was laid upon her. It was a trial for them to
be so widely separated, but each was in the proper
place. Sybil Jones was brought low with sickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and forced to hasten home. Eli Jones came from his
field of service, and called on his friend Daniel Smiley,
where he found his wife very ill; but recovery was
granted, and they came rejoicing to the family at
home.</p>

<h3><em>EAST, WEST, AND SOUTH.</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have always been thinking of the different ways in which Christianity
is taught, and whenever I find any way that makes it a wider
blessing than any other, I cling to that: I mean to that which takes in
the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most people as sharers."</p></blockquote>


<p>After their return from this last visit they passed
a few years in quiet work at home, often attending the
different quarterly meetings in New England, and generally
taking an annual trip to Newport to be present
at the yearly meeting, which was occasionally attended
by Friends from the West and from Great Britain,
bringing thither knowledge of far-off lands where the
whitening fields called for more laborers.</p>

<p>In 1845 they felt called to go over the meetings of
Friends in nearly all parts of the United States, and
this and the next year were mostly taken up with that
work.</p>

<p>Eli Jones has since travelled over this ground many
times, and has often visited the different yearly meetings
of America, but always with quite different feelings
from those which were in their hearts at the first extensive
visit. John Wilber had been "disowned" by
the Friends only two years before, and his upholders
who had separated from the Society were in many of
the meetings which they visited. There was a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
feeling of sorrow that a second unhappy division
should appear in the midst of peaceful neighborhoods
and the animosity arising from fruitless argument had
weakened the loving spirit and dampened the zealous
ardor of many who should have been the unbiased
spokesmen of the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>Eli and Sybil Jones endeavored to draw the two
parties together into the house of faith and true belief.
It is almost impossible in the midst of church differences
for any one who is interested to be unprejudiced
in his judgment. Bitterness shows itself in
the hearts of the most loving. Differences are exaggerated
and words are misunderstood for things.
The main body are over-eager to win back those
they are losing, while they are inflicting deeper wounds
by their too hasty blows at what seems the heresy
of their opponents, and the latter cherish a feeling
of glory in the size of the rent they are making.
These two Friends tried sweetly and gently to persuade
those differing with them that the ancient Rock
was the only foundation for their building. They
visited the families of nearly all the meetings and
impressed their thoughts on the individual members.
If perhaps they accomplished little in cementing
the two bodies, they did much to strengthen
the weak and to point the unsheltered to a Tower
of safety and defence. It may be interesting to
follow them in a few extracts from Sybil Jones's
journal:</p>

<p>"Left home 9th mo., 1845, with a certificate to visit
in the love of the gospel the yearly meetings of Ohio,
Indiana, Baltimore, and North Carolina. We took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
passage on the steamer John Marshall from Augusta
to Boston, and from there by cars to Lynn, where we
attended their quarterly meeting. Friends in this
meeting are brought under deep exercise on account
of the attendance of a committee from the Separatists
and John Wilbur in person. They took full liberty to
throw out their sentiments and bore very hard on
Friends, all of which Friends were mercifully favored
to bear with true Christian patience. After being detained
seven hours the meeting adjourned until nine
the next morning, at which time they convened without
interruption and were greatly refreshed together.</p>

<p>"From Lynn we went to New Bedford, where a
small meeting of the Wilburites is held, some of whom
we called to see and were treated kindly, but were
painfully afflicted in spirit under a sense of their alienation
from the unity of the Spirit by which we are called.
Friends here are not numerous, but upright standard-bearers.
In the morning attended Newtown meeting,
which was also attended by the Separatists (a few being
here). After a time of solemn retirement before the
Lord truth rose into dominion and a contriting time
it was."</p>

<p>They went on by boat to New York, and from there
to Philadelphia and Baltimore, where John Meader,
Thomas Willis, Richard Carpenter, and others met
them to go in their company farther west: "We
reached Mount Pleasant the day previous to select
meeting, which began the 8th of 9th mo. The spirit
of bitterness has made sad havoc here. The four
visiting Friends were duly proved in suffering with
the suffering. No notice was taken of any certificates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
on their minutes. The servants of the Lord in attendance
were of one heart and one mind, and there were
times amid the conflict that the gracious ear, I doubt
not, inclined to the fervent petition, 'Lord, save us or
we perish.' A calm stole over the troubled waves,
and ability was vouchsafed to proclaim the unsearchable
riches of Christ.</p>

<p>"The meeting closed on the 12th of the month, and
the next morning we proceeded on our way to Cincinnati.
We took the steamer New Hampshire, and
were more than five days on the Ohio River. The
water was low, so that we were often aground some
hours. We had a meeting on board with the passengers,
and it was crowned by the presence of Him
who holds the waters in the hollow of his hand and
causeth the mountains to flow down at His presence.
We were treated with great kindness and respect. The
first part of our passage I noticed some playing cards,
which brought me under great exercise, and after carefully
examining the subject I thought it my duty before
retiring to rest to walk to the table and express my
feelings. Asking leave of them, I proceeded to relieve
my mind, which was received kindly, and I saw no more
card-playing afterward. I felt great peace in taking
up this cross. May I always be willing to do His
will who leadeth safely and sustaineth the soul amid
every conflict!</p>

<p>"We arrived in Cincinnati on the 18th. After our
arrival I informed a Friend that the subject of visiting
families had rested with great weight upon my mind;
which he communicated to some of the select members,
and it resulted in an opportunity with all of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I opened the subject before them, and a sweet cementing
season of divine approval was graciously afforded.
They fully and feelingly united with us and encouraged
us to proceed therein."</p>

<p>They visited nearly all the families in that region,
and felt encouraged in the labor. She writes:</p>

<p>"I believe it is the design of the Head of the Church
to pour out a rich blessing on this part of His inheritance;
indeed, He seems turning His hand upon the
little ones, and will, I believe, raise up valiants among
the youth, who will publish with the voice of thanksgiving
and tell of all His wondrous works."</p>

<p>Having done much work in Ohio and Indiana, they
came over the Alleghany Mountains, and revisited
Baltimore, forming many pleasant acquaintances with
the Friends in that city, and holding meeting for public
worship, as well as visiting the families for more quiet
work. They next turned toward the South, and
reached North Carolina in time for the yearly meeting.
There was much feeling here in regard to the separation,
and an epistle from the Separatists was rejected at
this yearly meeting.</p>

<p>In regard to the slaves, she writes:</p>

<p>"Vital religion is very low. Truth has fallen in
the streets, and Equity cannot enter in some places.
Here is a suffering seed in many portions of this land
of slavery. Friends have borne in meekness a noble
testimony against its iniquity, and, though they often
feel disheartened at the shadowy prospect, I believe
their upright example has had, and will still have,
salutary influence. The Lord has inclined His gracious
ear to the multiplied cries of the oppressed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
those who suffer for them as being bound with them,
and will hasten the blessed day when Ethiopia shall
stretch forth her hand unto God and the oppressor
shall no more oppress.</p>

<p>"There are so many rents and divisions throughout
Christendom that many are crying, Who shall show us
any good? I earnestly desire that these overturnings
and siftings may tend to draw the people to the living
eternal Substance, to build on the ancient Foundation
of all the holy prophets and apostles. There is great
need of more dedication and a stirring up to greater
diligence in this land."</p>

<p>The work and service in Carolina were carried on
in great bodily weakness, and often Sybil Jones was
compelled to remain at home while Eli Jones and the
Friends with them attended the meetings. At the beginning
of the new year they returned to their Maine
home to pass a few quiet years before undertaking a
still more extensive journey.</p>

<div class="line indent8"><span class="smcap">Browning.</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>There is wonderful harmony in God's work in the
different kingdoms and sub-kingdoms of His domain.
When His method of working is resisted, there is
always harsh conflicting, and finally He removes the
obstacle; but wherever we look, so long as there is a
submission to His plan, there is never a jar, never a
halt on the road to the great end which He has in
view, be it in the growth of a tree, in the motion of a
world through space, in the maturity of animal or
human life, or in the development of spiritual being.
But the first rule that must be fulfilled before He can
rightly use any of His intelligent creations is that they
fully submit themselves to Him to be trained and used.
Just as the brook yields strict obedience to the gentle
impulse which moves it from its source on through
its winding channel to its home in the great ocean of
waters, so all who are to be the servants of the Most
High must be <em>willing</em> to become the instruments
through which He works, and must let Him flow
through unhindered. Those whom He will use He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
prepares just as much, and in a higher sense, as He
makes the lily grow&mdash;not by any toiling and spinning
on its part, but by putting a life within it which
animates and builds up the whole structure; and as
the lily adorns the spot in which He puts it, so His
workmen should beautify the vineyard where He sets
them.</p>

<p>It is a very marked fact in the lives of the two of
whom I am writing that they not only gave themselves
up to be prepared by Him who was to use them, but
they also waited until He showed them where they
should work. There is work everywhere which is
waiting to be done, nor does any one do well who idly
sits still until he is told just where to begin, but God
has His chosen workmen fitted on purpose for a special
place, as much as an earthly master-builder, and the
time comes to every one when it is imperative for him
to hear the order which he is to execute. The Lord
spake unto Moses often, and He who made known His
ways then has power to tell His will to whom he wishes
now, and the proper messenger does not embark before
the message comes.</p>

<p>I find in the earlier life of Eli and Sybil Jones that
their great, absorbing wish was that they might be in
full harmony with Him whom they served. They
looked up to be taught, and He gave just the right
service to enlarge and strengthen their powers, so that
they might be prepared for the more difficult undertaking
which now presented itself. No one who reads
the journal which follows will think they went to Liberia
prompted by their own feelings, but the service
was evidently <em>laid upon them</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>To understand properly the struggle through which
Sybil Jones passed before leaving her home, it will be
necessary to picture to ourselves the circumstances
surrounding her nearly half a century ago. She had
grown to womanhood in a little town in Maine, having
exceedingly limited opportunities for obtaining a knowledge
of the world and the ways of men and women;
she was now the mother of five children, who needed
their parents' care; she had just undergone the sorrow
of seeing many dear to her pass from earth, while still
others of her family were already on deathbeds: and
now she was to go from all that earth held dearest to
her, perhaps never to see even her own country again.
To-day to travel is the ordinary course; fifty years ago
it was a rare and momentous event for one to go far
from home. It would seem most hazardous to a frail
woman to go from Maine to Baltimore, there to embark,
not in a steamer with modern conveniences, but
in a sailing-packet with rough passengers and still
rougher crew, for the west coast of Africa. Let us
not wonder as we read her account that she waited
long and counselled earnestly with her own heart, for
if she should go self-sent only perils insurmountable
would be before her, but on God's errands, sent by His
command, she knew of nothing to fear.</p>

<p>The <cite>Friends' Review</cite> for 6th mo. 28, 1851, has the
following paragraph: "In the meeting of ministers and
elders of New England Yearly Meeting on Seventh
day, 14th, our dedicated friend Sybil Jones opened
a prospect of an extensive religious visit to Great
Britain, Ireland, some parts of the continent of Europe,
Sierra Leone, Liberia, and some islands on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
coast of Africa and in the West Indies; and her husband,
Eli Jones, informed the meeting that he believed
it his duty to bear her company in this extensive
and arduous engagement. The subject obtained the
weighty and feeling consideration of the meeting, and,
though Friends were fully sensible to the magnitude
and importance of the undertaking and of the apparently
inadequate state of her health, such a current
of unity with the prospect was experienced that all
doubt of its propriety was taken away; and they
were accordingly liberated for the service. The sympathy
and prayers of their friends will unquestionably
follow them."</p>

<p>As the most of the following year's work was in
Liberia, it may be well to speak briefly of the position
and condition of that country.</p>

<p>Liberia is a negro republic on the west coast of
Africa. Its length along the coast is about three hundred
and eighty miles, and its entire area about twenty-four
thousand square miles. Sierra Leone, the country
to the north of Liberia, was colonized by colored men
from Great Britain, assisted by such men as Grenville
Sharp, Wilberforce, and Clarkson, the first settlement
being made in 1787, and composed partly of negroes
who had served in the British army during our Revolutionary
War. This and successive colonies were terribly
weakened by the death-stroke of the African fever,
but they were finally successful; and American philanthropists,
who were eager to help an unfortunate
race, founded here in 1822 a colony of freedmen who
might enjoy the political and social privileges denied
to them in the United States. The town of Monrovia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was founded and named after James Monroe, then
President. They landed in the midst of heathendom,
and the first years were years of struggle; but these
colored men showed that they could govern themselves.
They drew up a constitution much like the
American, the first article of which read, "All men
are born equally free and independent, and among
their natural inherent and inalienable rights are the
rights of enjoying and defending life and <small>LIBERTY</small>;"
and the fourth section, "There shall be no slavery
within this republic."</p>

<p>The republic has a President, Senate, House of Representatives,
and a judicial department, so that good
laws are passed, explained, and enforced. In 1847 the
republic declared its independence, and was finally in
1861 recognized by the United States as a sovereign
state. The Methodist Church established a mission
here in 1833; the Presbyterian Church followed this
example, and sent J. B. Penny into the field the same
year. The American Episcopal Church was at work
in the republic as early as 1836, while the Baptists
turned their attention there in 1845, so that it was in
fact a "missionary republic." The present population
of the republic comprises about 18,000 civilized negroes,
chiefly of American origin, and 1,050,000 half-wild
natives, who are gradually adopting a settled life and
conforming to the habits of their civilized countrymen.
Professor David Christy said in a lecture in 1855: "If
a colony of colored men, beginning with less than a
hundred, and gradually increasing to nine thousand,
has in thirty years established an independent republic
amidst a savage people, destroyed the slave-trade on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
six hundred miles of the African coast, put down the
heathen temples in one of its largest districts, afforded
security to all the missions within its limits, and now
casts its shield over three hundred thousand native
inhabitants, what may not be done in the next thirty
years by colonization and missions combined were sufficient
means supplied to call forth all their energies?"</p>

<p>It was during this visit to Liberia that Eli Jones first
felt his heart fill with zeal for missionary work. One
day, going to pay a visit to President Roberts, he found
a large band of fierce natives assembled in the President's
room to have him arbitrate their quarrel. The
dispute being settled peacefully, the President introduced
Eli Jones, asking a noble-looking chief if he
would like to have this man go with them to talk
about God to their tribe. The prompt and earnest
answer was, "Yes, and we will build him a house if he
will come and stay." At once he saw in mind the
needs of these and the thousands of other human beings
waiting for some one to bring to them the fuller
teaching of the way to a higher Christian civilization,
and from that date he was more than ever desirous to
be an instrument of help.</p>

<p>The following poem was written by Elizabeth Lloyd<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

<p>The following account has been selected from Sybil
Jones's journal. It was written to be published soon
after their return, but publication was delayed, and now
for the first time it is made public. It will show, as
few other writings, the emotions and strivings of a sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
seeking soul. Her journals speak little, especially
in her earlier visits, of natural surroundings and ordinary
events, for her spiritual work seemed so weighty
that nothing was allowed to turn her eyes from that:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">So. China</span>, <em>12 mo., 1850.</em> Painful are the baptisms
that my poor trembling soul tries to endure patiently.
Forgive me, most gracious God, if I dare repine. Death
seems again lingering on our borders, and the remnant
of a once large family must soon diminish. My worthy
father seems drawing near the silent grave, but full of
bright hopes of a mansion in the eternal city. Though
well knowing that the "Judge of all the earth" will
do right, yet sad is the thought that soon we must lose
his cheerful society and instructive counsel. Oh that
this deep affliction may prove a salutary cup to the
soul, though very bitter to the taste! I learn many
awful lessons while sitting by his bedside. It is a
foretaste of heaven sweetly blended with a hope of
reunion around the throne. My soul is weighed down
with the prospect of more extended service in the
cause of our holy Redeemer, and lingers tremblingly
on Jordan's banks. Oh, this Jordan seems awful, but
I must descend to its bottom, and may the eternal God
be my refuge, and underneath the everlasting arms!
The billows overwhelm, and I sink in deep mire where
there is no standing. My health is frail and my spirits
flag. But amid all, the unchanging Rock is my
support.</p>

<p><em>1st mo., 1851.</em> With the unity of my friends I performed
some errands of love in some portions of our
own yearly meetings. I went forth in fear and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
weakness, but through abounding mercy the peace of
God fills my heart. In the course of this visit I had a
very interesting public meeting in Nantucket. My spirit
had long lingered around that little island of the sea,
and sweet was our communion together in the love
and power of truth. Dear father met me joyfully and
expressed great thankfulness for being permitted to
meet me again below. He said his soul was filled with
a Saviour's love, and he longed to go home to his
heavenly rest, to join with saints and angels in singing
the song of Moses and the Lamb for ever and ever.
It was a time of blessed communion. My mind is
deeply impressed with the language uttered frequently
in my inward ear: "Go offer a sacrifice similar to my
servant Abraham's;" which causes great fearfulness to
come upon me, and a sense of utter unworthiness and
inability for such a momentous work, feeling the least
and last of those who name the great Name.</p>

<p><em>2d mo.</em> Dear father seems near his eternal joy. He
told me to-day that he had been thinking I had a prospect
of some service in a distant land, and wished to
know if I thought of such a thing. As I had not
named it to any one, and felt restrained from speaking
of it, I hesitated, but at length opened my feelings, at
which he seemed introduced into much sympathy, and
desired me to be faithful, and then placed his hands
upon me, and poured out a fervent prayer to our
Father in heaven on my behalf for His holy presence
to go with me, and His almighty power to keep me
from all evil. It was a solemn season, for the painful
and yet happy thought mingled in this communion
that when my frail bark must venture on dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
seas his would be for ever anchored on the shore of
immortal joy.</p>

<p>This day I have been summoned to my sainted
father's bed of death. He was happy, full of heavenly
peace, and, resting his ransomed spirit on his Saviour's
breast, there breathed his life sweetly away. Our loss
is great, but his gain glorious.</p>

<p><em>2d mo.</em> We have conveyed his cherished form to
its last resting-place, and Jesus was with us and presided
over all. Oh let his name be praised and his
matchless goodness be adored.</p>

<p><em>3d mo.</em> My dear brother Augustine, whose health
has been declining for some years, seems rapidly following
father, at which our hearts are so stricken that
sorrow's bitter tears, fast falling on a sainted father's
grave, are even shared by our dearest brother, on whose
cheek flushes the crimson hectic omen of dissolution.
The painful thought of the departure of our dear
brother, the last earthly prop of the family, seemed
agonizing to our hearts. While these afflictive dispensations
are meted out, my spirit dwells in the great
depths of self-abasedness, and bears upon it too the
burden of a Saviour's love to sinners in a far-distant
land. Oh fix the trust of my tempest-tossed soul
immutably upon the unchanging Rock!</p>

<p>To-day I have returned from visiting my sweet
brother. He thankfully acknowledges the mercy of
being so calm and comfortable, though rapidly hasting
to the silent grave. Soon after the Lord saw fit to
plunge his soul into deep baptism for its purification.
His distress seemed entirely indescribable, but, being
encouraged to believe it was a refining process, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
thus painful, to prepare him to partake more fully of
the joys of God's salvation, his faith seemed strengthened
to hope for mercy and deliverance in the Lord's
time; which time at last came, and ushered in the
dawn of a glorious morning without clouds. His
heart was full of songs of joy. His constant theme
was the unsearchable riches of Christ. One day when
I entered his sick-room, he exclaimed, "Dear sister, I
am glad to see thee: I want to tell thee the joy of my
soul. I have heard the language, as intelligibly as
anything I hear with my outward ear, 'Speak comfortably
unto Jerusalem, cry unto her that her warfare
is accomplished, her iniquity is pardoned, for she hath
received at the Lord's hand double for all her sin;'
and, though I am most unworthy, I believe this is
applied to me, for my peace flows like a river." He
lived about five weeks from this time, and had indeed
no more conflicts; not a doubt or a cloud obstructed
the continual shining of the glorious Sun of Righteousness.
He often said that he was as full of songs
of joy as his poor heart could hold.</p>

<p>Deep baptisms abide me, and such a painful sense
is given me of my own inability and nothingness that
I am ready to shrink from attempting to open the subject
to my friends. My poor tempest-tossed soul
dwells near the valley and shadow of death. Liberia
seems to press upon my mind, but can all this be
called for at such weak hands?</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention in its place a testimony
of my dear brother's to me a short time before his
death. In an interview together he thus expressed
himself: "Dear sister, I have thought for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
past that the Master had a service for thee in distant
lands across the ocean, and I have this to say to thee:
<em>Go</em> with thy life in thy hand. It should not concern
thee whether thou sees thy native land again or not:
heaven is as near there as here. Go and tell the sinner
of a Saviour's love; bear the good tidings to lands afar
off. I wish you to make timely arrangements, so as to
move along quietly." I replied: "Dear brother, I do
not wish to repine at my lot, but I have been thinking
that thou art soon to be released from the conflict, and
that I must remain still longer in the field, and may
make some misstep and never reach thy glorious
home." To which he replied, looking at me most
impressively: "The dear Saviour will never leave thee;
He will never leave thee, but when thy work is finished
he will bring thee to meet me in heaven." This seemed
a renewed evidence that the service was required, but
so deep was my sense of frailty and entire inability to
do the work that I could not believe that the Master
would select me to go on such an important embassy,
a service of such vast moment. The evidence had
been very clear, but the feeling of unfitness for the
work seemed to hedge up the way entirely, and I
thought unless some person would come to me and
tell me the Lord required it and would fit me for the
work, I would not take a step. I thought I could not
receive it but from some one clothed with gospel authority;
and in looking over this class I selected dear
Benjamin Seebohm, who I knew was somewhere in
America. I was very much reduced in health, attributable
to painful watchings and partings, for I slept
little and had little appetite for food. Our monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
meeting day arrived, and, though my health was so
frail that I had gotten out to meeting but little for
some time, I felt an almost irresistible impression to
go. I accordingly went. As I entered the door almost
the first person I met was Benjamin Seebohm. I
could not have been more surprised at the appearance
of any person. In a moment my request rushed into
my mind, and thought I, "I am caught now; I have
done wrong in asking this sign, and may the Lord
forgive me and in mercy overlook this presumption,
and not grant the request unless it is His will, in condescension
to my low estate." The meeting gathered
under a great solemnity. It seemed to me that this
weighty service fell upon it, and after a time of very
solemn silence dear Benjamin arose and took up an
individual case, and so exactly described my feelings
and the service that no doubt remained but the
Most High had sent him with this message to me.
My soul was poured out like water and all my bones
shook. I thought all present knew it was I, though
not one but my husband had been apprised of it (it
having been to me too sacred a thing to speak of).
Indeed, I thought I was a spectacle for men and angels,
while the thoughts of my heart were revealed before
many witnesses and the work of the Lord proclaimed in
demonstration of the Spirit and with power. He spoke
most cheeringly&mdash;explained feelings of poverty as preparatory
to this work, that the creature may be laid
low in the dust and the blessed Name alone be magnified;
said the Lord would abundantly furnish for
every good word and work; that he reduced the
creature that all dependence on itself might be entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
removed, and our confidence firmly fixed on Himself,
who is the eternal foundation of wisdom and knowledge.
I did not see Benjamin again until the day
after my dear brother's funeral, when he came to our
house and lodged. He had a meeting in the place,
and precious and heart-searching was his gospel message.
He likewise had a sweet opportunity with the
mourners at the house of my lamented brother's
widow. Long will this beloved Friend and his consoling
heavenly testimony be remembered.</p>

<p><em>5th mo., Seventh day.</em> To-day is our select meeting,
and my trembling spirit is loth to fly, and yet afraid to
yield. Who, indeed, can know the agony of my spirit,
save</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"He who rolls the planets in their spheres</div>
<div class="line">And counts the lowly mourner's tears?"</div>
</div></div>

<p>I thought it best to name my prospect to my two
oldest children, a son sixteen and a daughter twelve.
The reply of both was, "Go, mother," though their
full hearts would hardly allow utterance until tears
lent relief. With me words were nearly lost in feeling
as I stood on Jordan's bank again to tempt its
fearful tide and deeper tread beneath its wave. I had
sat down to compose my thoughts for meeting, with
my grief-worn mother, by the side of the cradle where
lay (all unconscious of the deep pangs that rent our
hearts) my dear little Grelet, about ten months old.
The rest had all come in and were seated around,
when my dear James Parnell, as if fully conscious of
what was passing in his mother's heart, took a book
and commenced reading the following lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"FORWARD AND FEAR NOT.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">"Forward and fear not; the billows may roll,</div>
<div class="line">But the power of Jehovah their rage can control.</div>
<div class="line">The waves are in anger, but their tumult shall cease;</div>
<div class="line">One word of His bidding will hush them to peace.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>So appropriate and touching were the sentiments
that we were brought into tenderness.</p>

<p>I have had many fears that the weight of the important
visit will not be fully valued by all my dear
friends. My earnest prayer has been that they may
feel its weight as I have done, if it is of the Lord; if
not, that they may see it right to take the burden and
release me. I have this day ventured in great fear and
much trembling to open my prospect in the select
meeting, and, to my trembling admiration, it fell with
solemn weight and awfulness upon the assembly. The
great Head of His own Church dispensed His holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
power and presence and condescended to be a Spirit
of judgment to those who sat in judgment, and an
entire unity prevailed and cemented our hearts together
in the strong bonds of gospel fellowship and love,
and the great Name was held in reverence by those
about Him. I feel somewhat relieved, and, having
cast the burden upon my friends, the return of evening
finds me trusting in my Saviour in sweet peace.</p>

<p>To-day is our monthly meeting, my health very frail,
and my spirit awfully bowed before the Most High.
A sense of utter inability to proceed in this momentous
subject brings my soul into the dust of death, but "I
will look unto the hills from whence cometh my
strength." I was unable to attend the first meeting,
and in great bodily infirmity went to the last meeting
to attend to the business before me. I was strengthened
to stand up and to open to my dear friends the service
on my mind for the Lord my God in a distant land.
It fell with great impressiveness, and yet as the gentle
dew, upon the solemn assembly, and all present seemed
to have a sweet feeling of unity and sympathy. The
mountains indeed flowed down at the presence of the
Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>To-day our quarterly meeting convened, and it was
signally owned by the holy Head. In and over the
first meeting was a sweet solemnity, which lost none
of its sweetness after separation to transact the weighty
business of the Church, which to me never seemed
more weighty. I was mercifully helped again to spread
the important prospect before the Church, which received
its full and cordial unity, and many living testimonials
were given forth to the power and goodness of Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
whose ways are not as our ways. My heart was reverently
bowed before Him who makes a way through
the roaring billows of discouragement and causeth the
mountains to flee away at His presence before the footsteps
of His little ones.</p>

<p><em>6th mo., Newport.</em> Arrived on the island last evening,
and to-day I have to bring my prospect before the
Church in its select yearly meeting capacity. While
I have not a doubt but the great Master requires me
to make the sacrifice of laying the burden upon my
friends for their disposal, I feel a fervent desire that we
may not be permitted to proceed unless it is the Lord's
will. May it please Him in whom are the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge to dispense the spirit of
wisdom and judgment to the Church, and may the
awfulness of the service, with a sense of His dread
majesty, power, and holy cementing love, mantle the
whole assembly! I took my seat with my friends as
a weaned child, passive in His holy hands whose will
only I wished to know and do, with great fear upon
my spirit. The Lord helped me to declare unto the
Church what seemed to be His holy will who declareth
unto man what are His thoughts, who maketh the
morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places
of the earth. The Lord, the God of hosts, is His
name. A solemn awe pervaded the assembly, and at
the place of prayer each spirit seemed to wait until
a door of communication was opened by Him who
openeth and none can shut. The mind of the blessed
Head through the eternal Spirit was given forth in
many living testimonials. Great unity prevailed. The
prophetic declaration seemed applicable: "God came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
from Teman and the Holy One from Mount Paran;
His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was filled
with His praise." My soul returns unto her rest with
songs of joy. The endorsements placed upon our
certificates by the select meeting of ministers and
elders have been read to-day, which brought the subject
again before the meeting, and it proved the calling
of a solemn assembly and the charge reposed in the
Church. Our beloved Benjamin Seebohm expressed,
near the conclusion, that he had never seen the trust
of disposing of these weighty affairs better redeemed
than in the present instance. The convocation was
concluded in reverent, fervent supplication by dear
Lindley Murray Hoag, wherein near access was granted
to the mercy-seat. We were committed to the holy
keeping and safe guidance of the blessed Shepherd
when we should be in distant lands across the great
deep, and a rich heavenly blessing was implored upon
our tender children, whom for Jesus' sake we must
leave behind.</p>

<p>This evening we had a youth's meeting, which, as it
reflected no glory upon the creature, may have brought
honor to the Creator. Our yearly meeting was highly
blessed with the holy Presence, which continued through
its several sittings. On leaving the island the language
of my heart was, "Thou, O my Father, hast dealt very
graciously with the last and least and most unworthy."
But now comes the bitterness of death, to leave all
most dear in this life and go with our lives in our
hands at the bidding of the blessed Master; but my
earnest prayer is that we may be cheerful givers, for
the Lord loveth such. Every step thus far has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
taken in the ability which He gives us. As He has
ordered our steps, so may we be fully His.</p>

<p>After reaching home we began making arrangements
for embarking. It seemed best to break up the family,
as no suitable person could be found to take care of the
dear children, and we desired in this thing to be directed
by Him who hath called us to His work. Our eldest
son intends going to Haverford, a Friends' college in
Pennsylvania, with which we are well satisfied. As he is
at the tender age of sixteen, we had felt much solicitude
as to his place and associates, and this prospect seems
favorable, as he will have good company, and dear
Marmaduke and Sarah Cope of Philadelphia have
most kindly offered to take particular charge of him.</p>

<p>Many have been the marks of divine regard to us
and ours. We had often thought of Liberia on the
western coast of Africa as our first step, but thought
we must of necessity go by way of England; but in
the midst of our arrangements we received intelligence
that the Liberia packet was daily expected from the
coast, and would return soon&mdash;that it was the safest
and most comfortable conveyance, and that it would
stop for a few days to two weeks at most of the
principal ports on the African coast, so that we could
lodge on board every night; which was, with little exception,
an entire protection from the acclimating fever
so dangerous to the life of a Northerner. We sought
in this exigency divine direction, as we must leave so
much sooner than we had planned. This brought the
final parting so near that heart and flesh seemed to fail,
and the dear children seemed much grieved and cast
down at this sudden wrench, as it were, of heart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
heart in the most tender and endearing relations. Our
dear brother Cyrus seemed on the verge of eternity:
we had hoped to have seen him quietly at rest ere we
left our native land, and to have more time to visit our
other beloved relatives. We were brought very low,
even into the deeps, before the most high God, and
there in fervent supplication raised our hearts to heaven
in this our hour of need; and the watchword was,
"Gird on thy sword, take thy helmet and march; the
Lord hath need of thee now, for the enemy mustereth
his host, and my soldiers must be in readiness." Impalpable
mountains seemed to intervene, and high and
fearful swelled Jordan's deep waves. In this great
strait the language was intelligible: "Stand still and
see the salvation of God."</p>

<p><em>7th mo. 14th, Second day.</em> We received a telegraphic
despatch that the ship would sail the 20th, which
would occur the next First day. Our time seemed
limited indeed. To-day our monthly meeting occurred,
and it was the greatest solemnity, I think, ever
witnessed there. Then came the pangs of parting;
the ties of consanguinity and gospel fellowship were
being suddenly and unexpectedly torn asunder; we
might meet again, but probably it was a final separation
to some present. Our hearts were poured out
like water before the Lord and for each other's welfare.
Several touching testimonies were given forth&mdash;I might
safely say as the Spirit gave utterance. Dear James
Owen from Indiana delivered a solemn and pathetic
message touching the case of our immediate departure.
Our prayers were that our departure from those with
whom we had so long endeavored to labor faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
might stimulate them to greater dedication and faithfulness.</p>

<p><em>17th.</em> Making arrangements for our expedition, believing
it to be a divine opening for us, entirely without
our aid or concern. This <small>P. M.</small> we must leave and proceed
as far as Vassalboro' to take the cars to-morrow
morning. What tongue can tell my soul's anguish as
the tears flowed fast from each child's almost bursting
heart? Had it not been for the gentle accents of a
Saviour's love, "It is I, be not afraid; leave thy children
with me," I could not have left them. We took
our dear children to the home of dear husband's father,
two of whom&mdash;viz. Sybil Narcissa and Richard Mott&mdash;we
intended to take to Providence School. There
we must bid adieu to dear brother Cyrus, father and
mother, brothers and sisters, and friends who had collected
to take their leave. Here we had concluded to
leave our little Susan Tabor, about three years and
a half old, who would often look in my face and
exclaim with a touching look that reached my very
heart, "Don't leave me, mother, thy little daughter;
I will be a nice little lady; thee won't leave me, will
thee?" The strength of Israel was my confidence at
that moment. Our dear brother took our hands, and
after pronouncing the words, "The Lord be with you!"
he whispered the last and sad farewell while all around
were weeping. We then took an affectionate leave of
all present, and left the sweet scenes of childhood for
perhaps many a year. Then proceeded to our friend
Daniel Runnel's, where was our Eli Grelet, not quite
a year old. My heart yearned over this lovely boy,
whom I must cast from me. Then we separated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
taking the train for Providence School and dear James
Parnell, who was to take us to the cars. We arrived
at our esteemed friend Alton Pope's, where many
Friends had collected, among whom were the Indiana
Friends and dear John D. Lang and wife. We
sat down together for a little time, and great tenderness
and solemnity prevailed. I have lost two dear
brothers and five sisters and an estimable father, but
never did such hallowed, solemn, and unearthly feelings
steal over my overcharged heart as on this memorable
day. We rose early in the morning, and after taking
leave of our much-loved friends, Alton and Theodate
Pope, hastened to the cars. Dear James seemed more
cheerful than I supposed he could be. At length we
reached the dépôt, and the painful moment came to bid
adieu to our dear child; his bosom swelled with emotion
and fast fell the bitter tears. With a full heart I pronounced
my last parting blessing: "Dearest boy, farewell;
God bless and keep thee! I make this request
as though it were my last: give thy heart to thy dear
Saviour now in thy youthful days; He will comfort thy
heart when we are far away." We arrived at New
Bedford the same evening. On our way we paused a
few minutes at Portland, met our dear friends R. and
Sarah Horton, had a parting opportunity at the dépôt.
Next stopped a few minutes at Lynn, and several
friends accompanied us to Boston, where we had to wait
about an hour, which was very pleasant, as the company
of those dear friends was very cheering to us. They
brought us several packages of useful and interesting
things for our comfort on board of the ship. Our
hearts were touched with grateful feelings for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Christian kindness. At New Bedford lives my only
sister; her health is so frail it is not probable (should
we return) that she will survive till that time.</p>

<p><em>18th.</em> This morning we took the cars for Providence.
The children seemed to forget their trouble in their
interest in new objects. We stopped about four hours
in Providence, where we left the children and parted
with our friends Joseph and Sybil Estes, who had
accompanied us from Vassalboro'. We took our leave
of the dear inmates of the Friends' school in a collective
capacity&mdash;a very solemn season, our two little ones
being with them. We bowed before the Most High
and commended them to the care of Him whose mercy
endures for ever. The dear children, with several
others, went with us to the dépôt, where dear Samuel
Boice and wife joined us. We gave a farewell glance
to all. The dear little ones' faces were bathed in tears.
Here it would be proper to say that we received the
kindest attention from the superintendents, Silas and
Sarah Cornell, and many others. These dear friends
exerted themselves to procure some more needful
things for us with great interest. Having so little
time, and going by the way of Africa, we were lacking
in some things which they most kindly supplied. May
Heaven's blessings rest upon them!</p>

<p><em>7th mo. 20th, 1851, Chesapeake Bay, on board Liberia
packet.</em> We arrived in Baltimore about ten o'clock
last evening, and found the ship had left the wharf and
stood off about eight miles waiting for us, and that we
should be expected to be on board this morning.
Having taken a solemn and affecting leave of the last
familiar face in our native land, we retired to our room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and, though now separated from all most dear, we felt
the loving presence of our Saviour.</p>

<p><em>21st.</em> Made some arrangements to fit up our little
"floating home" to make it as agreeable as possible.
Captain and officers very kind, and all seem inclined
to try to make us happy.</p>

<p><em>22d.</em> Retired to our cabin after breakfast to read a
portion of Scripture and to wait upon the Lord. I
felt drawn to supplicate the throne of grace for all on
board our frail bark, that the God of our lives would
keep us in safety and bless and protect our precious
children in our absence. Our time is mostly taken up
in writing, as the pilot will return at the capes. Dear
Eli is engaged a part of the day in teaching the emigrants
to read, cipher, etc. We have some interesting
conversation with them, and find them as a whole
rather intelligent, and even pious.</p>

<p><em>24th.</em> Calms and head winds seem to be our daily
portion, but the heavenly Pilot holds the ship and the
winds in His holy hands. Teaching the emigrants
and writing to our friends keep us busy; health comfortable.</p>

<p><em>26th.</em> To-day brisk wind; we expect to pass the
capes. At six o'clock the pilot-boat came alongside
and took off the pilot and a large package of letters.
We shall not hear from home or have any means of
sending intelligence until we reach Africa.</p>

<p><em>27th.</em> We behold another morning in safety. It is
First day, but fearful has been the night. We had a
thunder-shower with furious winds. The rain fell in
torrents and the thunder rolled deep, while the vivid
lightning seemed to envelop the ship in liquid fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Our trembling vessel would dash into ocean's depths
apparently, and then rise upon the mountain wave.
We were brought to test ourselves whether we were
willing to make our graves in the caverns of the deep
or gird on the armor for the Lord's battles. To-day
we entered the Gulf Stream. We are making ten
miles an hour. We are so enfeebled with last night's
rolling that we are neither of us able to sit up. The
approach of night again fills us with apprehension.
The night again stormy. We looked up in that hour
of dismay and found an eye to pity and an arm to
save.</p>

<p><em>29th.</em> Stormy night, exceedingly rough; not safe to
stay in our berths. With loss of appetite we are somewhat
reduced. Felt somewhat as Noah's weary dove
that found no place of rest above the cheerless waters.</p>

<p><em>30th.</em> Boisterous weather still, but we are rapidly
nearing Africa's distant coast. Our helpless souls
hang on Thee.</p>

<p><em>31st.</em> Rather more calm. My dear Eli is improving,
though still feeble. A number of sweet little birds
cheered us to-day, following the ship some distance.
I think that they deserve a better name than "Mother
Carey's chickens." At eleven o'clock we took our
seats in our cabin (it being meeting-day at home) to
try and worship Him who remains with them. Our
spirits refreshed in blessed communion. At the evening
sacrifice we had a fresh assurance of the angel of
the Lord's presence. Delightful evening, every sail
spread with fair wind. At twelve o'clock, 1360 miles
from Cape Henry. We feel our infirmities, but can
sing of the Lord's judgement and mercies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><em>8th mo. 2d.</em> We have proceeded rapidly since leaving
the capes; this is the seventh day since leaving
them, and we have gone two thousand miles. Providence
has sped us on our way. We find some very
interesting persons among the emigrants, with whom
we converse freely; we find them engaged to serve
their God with diligence and love.</p>

<p><em>First day.</em> A most charming morning. At eleven
o'clock we sat down in our little meeting. We have
felt a very painful exercise since being on board this
ship. Our souls have been lifted up to God alone,
that He would order our service for Him among the
inmates of the ship, and the time, not daring to move
(whatever we may suffer with the burden upon our
spirits) until the command is given: for this we wait
in watchfulness and prayer. After meeting it seemed
best to us to try for a meeting, and, no obstacle appearing,
at the time appointed nearly all assembled,
and the short silence was blessed with His presence
who is invisible. With awfulness and fear we ventured
to make known our requests, and our dependent souls
were made joyful in the house of prayer. Great
solemnity pervaded the assembly, and these desperate
spirits seemed contrited and made to fear. We were
comforted with the spirits of a little band of humble
followers of the Lord in this meeting, whom doubtless
the Saviour loves. So great was my relief after this
meeting that the language of my soul was, "Return
unto thy rest, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with
thee." Last night seemed sweet and peaceful. We
heard neither oaths nor imprecations, with which our
ears had been saluted many painful nights before our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
meeting. Fearfulness came upon us often when we
heard the great Name blasphemed, and such angry
threats that we thought there was great danger of
their killing each other. A great change is apparent,
especially with the captain. May the Ancient of Days
be honored for His power!</p>

<p><em>5th.</em> This morning the ocean is very smooth, scarcely
a breath to ruffle the blue. We have made little progress
for two days. A sail has been just in sight since
First day <small>P. M.</small> We have been a little suspicious of
it. This morning we discovered a small boat approaching;
there was considerable conjecture with
regard to the business of the little messenger. She
came alongside, containing six men, one of whom
tremblingly ascended the side of the ship, assisted by
a rope. He looked around, apparently with mingled
emotions of hope and fear; his first idea must have
been that we had a cargo of slaves. He was met with
looks of kindness, and informed us that the first mate
was ill and that he came to obtain some assistance.
It seemed they had been as shy of us as we of them,
but at length necessity had driven them to the hazardous
attempt. We had a colored physician on board,
but he seemed very unwilling to go with them, still
fearing that some trick might be played upon us. My
husband offered to go with them, for which my heart
rejoiced, for I had felt a secret distress for them, and
thought we might be becalmed for some good to them.
The little boat left the ship, and had not rowed half the
distance before a brisk fair wind arose and filled our
flagging sails, and away we made for the disturbed
vessel, and soon came alongside. The boat returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for medicine, etc. It afforded my dear Eli great satisfaction
to give them a little assistance from our small
stock of comforts. To nearly all of us it seemed a
providential interposition. A strong breeze now wafts
us on with thankful hearts, I trust. The ship proved
to be a whaler from Provincetown, out seven months.
They wished for some books, and we had the pleasure
of furnishing them with several interesting books,
tracts, and papers, with which they seemed delighted.
To-day we take the trade-winds, so that we have a fair
prospect of a quick voyage; for this we feel we depend
on Him who commands the wind. It seems that all
hearts on board try to manifest their kindness and
respect.</p>

<p><em>6th.</em> Every sail filled with a delightful breeze. Were
greatly refreshed together in reading and meditation
upon Him who is our only crown of rejoicing in our
low estate. Ability was granted to ask a blessing on
the dear children. We have a very pleasant company&mdash;have
not heard a profane word since the meeting.
I never saw so great a change in a ship's crew. It is
indeed the Lord's doings.</p>

<p>Saw a nautilus to-day. It spread its thin sail to
catch the rising breeze. The sailors call it a "Portuguese
man-of-war." Dear Eli is quite seasick to-day.
At eleven o'clock sat down with as many emigrants
as could be comfortably seated in our cabin, to try to
worship Him who graciously sustains us upon the
rolling deep. It proved a season of heavenly communion.</p>

<p><em>8th mo. 3d, Sixth day</em>, lat. 33° 53' N., long. 36° W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
A school of porpoises played round the ship for some
time this morning. They seemed delighted at amusing
us, jumping several feet out of the water and darting
to and fro. We seemed nearing the shores of such
intense interest to most on board, and, though a sea-life
is not desirable, I do not feel anxious about reaching
Africa. Great and fearful is our responsibility, and
dangers seen and unseen are in this untrod path. May
the God of our salvation have mercy upon us and
direct our every step!</p>

<p><em>First day, 10th.</em> Unable to sit up this morning. Dear
Eli sat by my birth during meeting-hour, and our hearts
were raised in aspiration heavenward. <small>P. M.</small> Able to
sit up toward evening, and we concluded that it would
be best to try for a meeting, which collected a little
after sunset under a clear sky and a full moon, all
canvas filled. The moon shed a mild intermingled
gleam through the shrouds of our gallant ship, and
delightful indeed were our meditations. The silence
was at length broken by dear Eli in a feeling testimony
to the universality of divine grace. The people were
encouraged to forsake their sins and come to Jesus the
Saviour of the world. It was a sweet, heavenly season.
We felt to tell them that it was not a light thing to be
thus remembered by Him who rolls the planets in
their spheres. A great change is apparent in all on
board. Everything is almost as we could wish, compared
with what it was when we came. May we do
nothing to diminish the reputation of our beloved
Society!</p>

<p>The captain says that we are about six hundred
miles from the coast of Africa in a straight line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><em>14th of 8th mo.</em> Saw a whale to-day: shall pass the
tropic of Cancer to-night; chilly. About two days'
sail from Cape Verde.</p>

<p><em>17th.</em> Cool and pleasant, very different from expectation
in a tropical climate. I have been ill to-day; dear
Eli somewhat better. It being First day, we were
present in spirit with our friends at home in their meeting.
Spoke a ship, and the captain and dear Eli took
boat and went off to her. She proved to be the St.
Paul, bound to Cowes. We sent a few lines home by
her.</p>

<p><em>20th.</em> A dreadful storm is on the main, and our
ship is like a leaf in the winds. Several sails are split,
and we may lose all before morning.</p>

<p><em>21st.</em> My dear Eli is not able to sit up much, which
saddens me.</p>

<p><em>25th.</em> But little progress. I do not feel much anxiety
but for my dear Eli, who seems failing every day
from loss of appetite and want of things to make him
comfortable, and for the poor emigrants, many of
whom suffer from the same causes.</p>

<p><em>26th.</em> This evening there is quite an excitement on
board. My Eli discovered land; the captain thinks it
may be Grand Cape Mount. The captain just called
us on deck and a novel scene presented itself. Our
ship seemed gliding through a stream of liquid fire,
while each crested wave shed a beautiful silver light
amid sparkling gems that bespangled the whole face
of the deep. Thinking we might soon reach land, it
seemed right to have another opportunity with the
emigrants, which we obtained this <small>P. M.</small> We felt an
impression that some one present would soon be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
home to rest in Jesus. It proved a satisfactory season,
thankfully received by them.</p>

<p><em>28th.</em> This morning early we were saluted with the
joyful intelligence that we were near Cape Mesurado.
We hastened on deck, and once more beheld the
"dark green robes of earth," which never seems so
lovely as after a sea-voyage. The noble promontory
is nearly covered with a thick forest, interwoven with
luxuriant vines that hang in rich drapery from the
branches of the trees, and the stately palm tree rears
its lofty head high in air, like some tall cliff. It was
Nature in her chastest charms arrayed. Soon my
thoughts were diverted from this deeply interesting
scene to one as novel as can well be imagined. The
native canoes appeared, manned by natives without
clothing. Soon the water seemed almost alive with
them, and the air rang with strange sounds. We made
ready to go on shore. I cannot describe my feelings
at this moment, but, like Peter, I thought that I must
call nothing common or unclean that God had cleansed.
The captain, dear Eli, and I were soon seated in one
of our boats manned by natives, and in a few minutes
passed the bar in safety and reached the city of Monrovia,
just in rear of the cape, and with grateful
emotions set our feet on the shores of Africa.</p>

<p>B. V. R. James welcomed us to the shore, and kindly
invited us to go to his house and refresh ourselves.
We proceeded up a gentle ascent through the city as
far as his house&mdash;were pleasantly received; took breakfast
and dined with them. Called on President Roberts
and his wife, who received us cordially; delivered our
papers and letters; they kindly invited us to call again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and make our home with them if agreeable. Called
also at James B. McGill's, a very interesting family,
and returned before nightfall to our floating home. It
has been a fine day, though in the midst of the rainy
season.</p>

<p><em>29th.</em> Just returned from shore; had a pleasant day
and a delightful walk. Took breakfast at James McGill's,
who with his pleasant wife entertained us very
cheerfully. Dined with Beverly Wilson, a Methodist
minister, who with his wife interested us highly.
Visited the Alexander high school, B. V. R. James
teacher. It contained seventy scholars, fifty of whom
were present. They reflected credit on their competent
teacher by their advancement and circumspect
demeanor. We thought them as good scholars as
those of the same age in America. We imparted
some religious instruction and suggested some trifling
improvements, with which the pious teacher and pupils
seemed pleased. One is our Master, even Christ, and
all we are brethren.</p>

<p><em>30th.</em> Morning rainy; dear Eli has been ashore;
thinks the place increases in interest every time he
visits it. He has made two appointments for to-morrow,
one at the Methodist and one at the Baptist house.</p>

<p><em>31st, First day.</em> Morning rainy, but we thought best
to try and meet our appointments. Arrived in time,
but got somewhat wet; changed clothes. We felt it
to be no ordinary occasion as we passed through the
throng to our seats and then mingled in sweet and
sacred communion for the first time with dear brethren
and sisters in a distant land, for whose souls we had
long borne the burden of a dying Saviour's love. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
silence was impressive, and the streams of that river
that gladdens the heritage of God circulated sweetly
through the assembly. The holy fervor of gospel love
filled our hearts to the great abasedness of the creature.
Ability was given us to show forth that living faith
that works by love to the purifying of the heart, and
to point out the difference between this saving faith
and a dead faith that the world and its spirit will overcome.
We were melted together as the heart of one
man. The Lord reigned gloriously. At the close of
this solemnity the people wished to get our hands,
giving demonstrations of great joy at meeting us, and
bidding us welcome to their shores with great blessing.
Dined at James B. McGill's. Our afternoon meeting
was increasingly interesting. We were led to explain
the nature of that worship which only can be acceptable
to God. Returned to our ship with the testimony
sealed upon our heads. Not unto us, but unto Thy
great Name, be all the honor.</p>

<p><em>9th mo. 1st.</em> Morning rainy; had to remain in the
packet; evening more pleasant. Passed our time in
writing, reading, etc.</p>

<p><em>9th mo. 2d, Third day.</em> Morning rainy; dear E. went
ashore. He seems quite improved, which is very
cheering. We feel quite at home on board, though
far away dwell the hearts bound to us by the tenderest
ties.</p>

<p><em>3d.</em> We went on shore and called on Sarah Smith, a
pious colored woman who keeps a place of refreshment;
then called on President Roberts and wife, and had a
very interesting conversation on several subjects relative
to the interest and welfare of the republic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
President was truly courteous and affable. In his
manner there is an elegant simplicity adorned with
Christian piety. He said, "I am truly thankful the
Lord has sent you here, and for your prayers for us in
your native land." His wife's highest ornament is
piety, which is sweetly cherished in her gentle heart.
After dinner, accompanied by the President and his
wife, we repaired to the Presbyterian place of worship
(a previous appointment). The house was crowded,
but orderly and still. It was given us to deal very
plainly with the people.</p>

<p><em>4th.</em> Raining; dear E. went on shore and visited a
native town, with which he was much interested. I
felt the privation of remaining in the ship; I was
somewhat impatient at being confined in my cage-like
cabin. The deck being very wet, I was somewhat circumscribed,
but in settling up the day's accounts I did
not feel fully satisfied, and my earnest prayer is that
I may keep my mind stayed on the Lord.</p>

<p><em>5th.</em> Just returned from shore; have enjoyed the
day much. Visited a private school taught by
Georgianna Johnson, and suggested some improvements.
Called on President Roberts and wife (they
being directors of two or more female benevolent
societies) to obtain their consent to meet those societies
at their own time and place. We met them the following
day, and had a very interesting conference. Suggested
some improvements, such as ameliorating the
condition of those immigrants, many of whom are
destitute of employment or not willing to work, who
lead a wretched life of indolence and consequently
vice. The President said that it was a source of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
solicitude to himself; he was fearful of the continuance
of this state of things. We suggested a house of industry.
This struck him pleasantly as the very antidote
needed. Called at George R. Ellis's, who is a
magistrate. We were kindly received.</p>

<p><em>6th.</em> Went on shore; had a very interesting opportunity
with the Ladies' Association (some of the most
intelligent females in Liberia). They managed their
business in a correct and orderly manner, and by their
records and accounts show that they are doing much
for suffering humanity here. The emancipated slaves are
sent here nearly penniless, except their portion of land,
which is an unbroken forest, and six months' provisions,
which are exhausted during the process of
acclimating. The fever reduces them much. It is the
judgment of the most intelligent residents of Liberia
that it is best for the immigrants soon after their
arrival to take up their farms and work a small portion
of each day, clearing their land and planting sweet
potatoes, and with the abundance of fruit growing
around them they could live comfortably. This has
been tried by some, and far less die. With the fever
much depends on keeping up the courage; there is
but little chance for those who abandon exercise.</p>

<p><em>7th.</em> We went on shore at an early hour; took breakfast
at Uriah McGill's. Went to a First-day school
containing ninety-four children, twenty-five of whom
are natives; the latter are not able to read the Bible.
At half-past two attended a meeting for the children.
The Baptist house, being the largest, was selected, and
was well filled; they were orderly and attentive. I
trust impressions were made that will never be effaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><em>8th.</em> E. went on shore. In the afternoon he returned
with our valued friend James B. McGill and two colored
ladies, with their servants, the latter going to Greenville,
Sinon county. We left the shores of Monrovia
with a comfortable evidence that our labors were acceptable
to Him who had sent us forth. We were
quite cheered with the prospect of saying that we had
personal acquaintances in Liberia.</p>

<p><em>9th.</em> Anchored in Bassa Cove. Thank God for the
blessings and mercies that have attended us on this
embassy of love!</p>

<p><em>11th.</em> Came to anchor off Greenville.</p>

<p><em>13th.</em> Went on shore and made arrangements for
meetings&mdash;in the morning at the Baptist house, in the
afternoon at the Presbyterian. The Methodist minister
cordially invited us to attend the afternoon sitting of
the quarterly meeting, saying the meeting should be
at our disposal to worship in our own way. We were
refreshed in the Lord.</p>

<p><em>First day, 14th.</em> Had good meetings. At the Presbyterian
house many stood about, not able to get inside.
We were blessed together in heavenly places. Dined
at Judge Murray's.</p>

<p><em>Second day, 15th.</em> Set sail for Cape Palmas; anchored
on account of head winds. I fear we cannot visit the
town, Settra Kroo.</p>

<p><em>16th.</em> We are in sight of Settra Kroo still. May the
Lord keep us in safety!</p>

<p><em>17th.</em> At anchor off Nasma Kroo; went on shore;
called at the only two colonist houses there, then
visited the native village. Here a strange scene presented
itself: the females were entirely naked, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a small covering about the loins, mothers with their
naked infants on their backs, from one month old and
upward; lasses with their skin painted indelible black
and shining with palm oil, with which they are besmeared,
came in crowds and surrounded us, gazing
at me, crying, "White mammy;" others ran from us
with fear. We gave the mothers some crackers, and
soon every one that could get a child (sometimes quite
as big as the pretended mother herself) had one packed
on her back to get a cracker also. They are a very
shrewd people&mdash;fine forms and well-proportioned. We
visited the queen, who has a separate room in the king's
house. He was absent; she received us quite graciously:
her body was striped with white paint. We
thought best to try for a meeting. The king's house
was selected. One of the natives undertook to notify
the meeting. He passed on before us, stopping at each
house, and very soon the people might be seen running
from every point toward the house where they were to
have a "God palaver," as they call it. A number gathered.
A native named Giando undertook to interpret
for us. They were attentive&mdash;promised with clamorous
acclamation that they would do as we told them. The
meeting was relieving, and we have great cause for
gratitude. Before we left the village several females
had painted their faces white, which made them look
ridiculous in the extreme.</p>

<p><em>18th.</em> Set sail for Cape Palmas again. Came to
anchor after sunset.</p>

<p><em>19th.</em> Went on shore; called at Dr. McGill's; they
received us pleasantly. He occupies the vacancy made
by the lamented death of Governor Rupworm. Dined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at F. Burns's, the Methodist minister. We were interested
in the information they gave us of the colony
and natives. The latter have three villages very compact,
and with all the heathen customs, the most disgusting
of which is their unclad forms that are seen
in every direction, forming a striking contrast to the
neat dwellings, decent clothing, and intelligent countenances
of the colonists. On the outermost point of
this high promontory is a lighthouse, and about it the
colonists' houses stand surrounded with fine gardens
and the beautiful African fruit trees. Made an appointment
at the Methodist house for to-morrow.</p>

<p><em>20th.</em> We have not been able to meet our appointment,
the swell is so great. We have been somewhat
disappointed in not getting to town, but are sure that
all is well under the supervision of Him who commands
the elements in His own consummate wisdom.</p>

<p><em>21st, First day.</em> Beautiful morning; got safely on
shore, and had a large meeting in the Methodist house.
In the sweet covenant of peace and joy the meeting
closed.</p>

<p><em>22nd.</em> Got on shore, and rode in a small carriage
drawn by natives about two miles into the country,
accompanied by Dr. McGill and his amiable wife.
Delighted with the scenery. The dwellings of the
colonists are comfortable, but most of their farms are
uncultivated; very rich soil. We have a strong
apology to make for the indolence in Africa: most
of the settlers hitherto are emancipated slaves, worn
out with hard service in the land of oppression, from
which they have been sent after their spirits and
strength are wasted by unrequited toil. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
meet this enervating climate. A number of energetic
husbandmen should be sent out with every colony to
inspire them. Manual-labor schools would doubtless
succeed here, but the present operations must fail to
arrive at the happy results anticipated by the philanthropists.</p>

<p><em>23d.</em> Went on shore and had a most interesting
meeting with the children. Many youthful eyes were
bedewed with tears as they heard the glad tidings of
a Saviour's love.</p>

<p><em>24th.</em> Had a meeting at the Episcopal house. The
Lord was with us. We gave books and tracts.</p>

<p><em>25th.</em> We were saddened by the conviction that some
of us would meet no more on earth. We left Cape
Palmas with an additional interest for Africa. We feel
that we are only the pioneers&mdash;that the Lord will send
yet more honorable members of his household to this
land.</p>

<p><em>27th.</em> Very weak. Came to anchor off Sinon. My
E. went on shore, but I thought best to remain, write,
and arrange for to-morrow. E. returned wearied, but
much delighted with his excursion into the country.</p>

<p><em>28th.</em> Went early on shore, and, taking our vessel's
boat and crew, proceeded up the Sinon River about
two miles to a colonist settlement. Our meeting was
well attended and the word was heard with gladness.
We walked in a footpath some distance in a smart
shower, and were wet and much fatigued. Rested and
dried our clothes a little before the meeting. The
people more industrious than any we have seen before
in Liberia.</p>

<p><em>30th.</em> Went on shore; had a meeting in the Baptist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
house. It was a final parting and a heavenly season.
No doubt that we shall have the prayers of these dear
people.</p>

<p><em>10th mo. 3d.</em> Anchored this <small>P. M.</small> off Bassa.</p>

<p><em>4th.</em> Went on shore, but with much difficulty, it being
the worst bar on the coast. We proceeded along the
coast until we found a place to land in safety. The
natives managed with great skill, and as soon as we
came near land they sprang into the water and caught
me, and in a minute set me down high and dry, seemingly
highly gratified, exclaiming "Mammy no wet."
We called at a little cabin and got a cup of tea made,
and when the rain subsided we proceeded to the town.
Beautiful country, covered with orange trees and guava,
but farms sadly neglected. I think the plough is
needed as much as missionary labors, for without the
former the latter cannot accomplish much.</p>

<p><small>P. M.</small> Very rainy; had a ride in a hammock, or rather
a substitute for one&mdash;a piece of native cloth with the
ends fastened together with ropes, and a pole passed
through loops; the poles rested on the natives' shoulders.
It was placed on the ground for me to step in
and lie down, but I begged the privilege of walking,
which was refused, as it would injure my health, for the
rain was pouring. I did not like it, although I did not
get wet. The idea of a bier was constantly presenting
itself, together with the fear that it was too great a
burden for the poor natives. A terrible storm came
up on our way back to the ship, and we nearly lost
our lives in the angry waves.</p>

<p><em>5th, First day.</em> Had a meeting in the evening on
board, as it was very rainy. In retirement this day we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
could say with the Psalmist, "How precious are thy
thoughts unto me!"</p>

<p><em>7th.</em> Went ashore and had a meeting at Edina, on
the north side of the St. John's River. It proved a
memorable solemnity.</p>

<p><em>8th.</em> Went on shore and had a meeting on the south
side of the St. John's, at Bassa. The blessed Head of
the Church was pleased to feed the hungering multitudes
through His poor instruments. A number collected
to witness our departure, and we took an affectionate
leave of them, mingled with sadness, on our
final departure from Bassa Cove.</p>

<p>Set sail about five o'clock with a brisk wind, which
would take us to Monrovia by sunrise, but it soon
became calm, and we came to anchor. The Lord
knows what is best.</p>

<p><em>9th.</em> We are quite anxious as we approach Monrovia,
for here we must decide whether to remain in Africa
and wait a passage to England (should none offer before
the packet leaves), or return to Boston and thence
embark to Liverpool. I trust we are resigned to either
as the Lord wills.</p>

<p><em>10th.</em> Anchored off Cape Mesurado. Dear Eli went
on shore and found letters from home. We read them
together with much joy, as they contained intelligence
that all was well with the dear children and those at
home. Boundless is our debt of gratitude. One of the
immigrants who was in good health at the time of our
last meeting on board is dead. We learned that she
died in peace, but was cruelly treated by her husband.</p>

<p><em>11th.</em> Went on shore accompanied by the President's
wife. I took a bundle of tracts and visited all the sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and infirm, distributing tracts and imparting such messages
of gospel love as were given me.</p>

<p><em>First day, 12th.</em> Went on shore quite comfortably,
although it was wet, and attended a meeting at the
Baptist house. Our meetings here have been signally
blessed. Truly the Lord's name is great in Zion.</p>

<p><em>13th.</em> Rainy, but got on shore, and made calls and
distributed tracts. No way opens yet for Sierra Leone.
We are wholly dependent on Him who makes a way.</p>

<p><em>14th.</em> Called at U. McGill's, J. B. McGill's, Beverley
Willson's. I then distributed tracts, and I think that
I never saw so much gratitude manifested in any part
of the world I ever visited. As I passed their little
cots they followed me in numbers; even children
joined, holding out their hands begging for a tract.
At length all were gone, but a few more on board.</p>

<p><em>15th.</em> Dear Eli went up the river St Paul, and visited
New Georgia, Upper and Lower Caldwell, Virginia, and
Kentucky. I spent the day making calls and giving
tracts.</p>

<p><em>17th.</em> It is a time of seeking the Lord among the
people. The youth are flocking to the Saviour. May
a glorious accession be made to the militant Church
from Africa!</p>

<p><em>19th.</em> Went on shore, and had a meeting at the
Methodist house, and it was a solemn occasion, as it
was our final meeting.</p>

<p><em>20th.</em> Went on shore for the last time, as the ship
would sail at three o'clock. Made several calls, one on
a sick immigrant from Antigua. Has been sick seven
months, reduced to a skeleton; said he had a wife and
two children in his native land. As he spoke of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his eyes filled with tears, and "God's will be done!"
fell from his trembling lips.</p>

<p>I went with some ladies to the highest point of this
commanding promontory. Had a fine view of the
town and mountains toward the interior. We met
many a smiling face and heard many a "Thank you"
as we stopped at the little cots to distribute tracts.
The Liberians are very anxious to get these little messengers,
and read them with interest. We hope they
may be a blessing to them. I handed one to an aged
woman, who clasped it to her bosom and exclaimed,
"The Lord bless you! I will keep it to read while
I live, and when I die I will have it put into my
coffin."</p>

<p>We have left Monrovia, and as the land recedes from
view the pangs of separation from many, if not all, are
keenly realized, not only by us, but by the group on
shore. But as the clouds dispersed around the setting
sun his last sweet rays rested upon the rich foliage,
and then, veiling his face in a mantle of crimson clouds,
withdrew. We leave Africa with sheaves of peace.</p>

<p><em>21st.</em> Made little progress to-day. Though our returning
in the ship is very unexpected, yet all is peace,
and it seems to us to be in the will of Him who
brought us in safety across the mighty deep. No way
has opened for us to go to Sierra Leone or England.
We intend to return to America (if no new opening
appears) and embark at Boston for Liverpool. In this
way we may see our little ones; which seems almost
too great a favor. We have thoughts of stopping
at St. Thomas, and thence prosecuting our contemplated
visit among the islands, if we can make an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
arrangement with the captain that will answer and it
seems right.</p>

<p><em>22d.</em> Delightful weather. This morning in silent
waiting before the Lord He gave us to feel His holy
presence near, and an assurance that He would still
lead us and instruct us.</p>

<p><em>23d.</em> The captain concludes to leave us at St. Thomas
if we desire it. We had looked toward home, but the
prospect seems somewhat like closing up. The will
of the Lord be done!</p>

<p>Some swallows appeared this morning and flew into
the cabin. They lingered about all day. They may
be emigrants from cold New England's clime. They
brought with them sweet thoughts of scenes and lands
far over the blue depths of ocean.</p>

<p><em>28th.</em> Clear weather. Think it may be best to abandon
the thought of returning home, and stop at St.
Thomas, one of the West Indies, and commence our
next labors. This seems a favorable opening, for a
Northern tour will be too great a change of climate.
My health seems greatly improved by a warm climate.</p>

<p><em>30th, First day.</em> We sat down for meeting together,
it being meeting-day at home. We felt as the disciples
journeying toward Emmaus; we felt our hearts warmed
and tendered together.</p>

<p><em>31st.</em> St. Thomas is in our minds' view, but whether
we shall get there or not lies in the bosom of futurity.
It will probably take two weeks longer to reach there
if the ship touches it. Our daily prayer is to be directed
aright.</p>

<p><em>11th mo. 1st.</em> Dear Eli is much better, and my health
is quite good. The cook is quite sick; I fear he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not recover. He is in great distress both of mind and
body. How wise to prepare for such an awful time in
health!</p>

<p><em>2d.</em> Last evening we read a chapter by the bedside
of the distressed sailor. My heart was poured out in
prayer.</p>

<p><em>3d.</em> We are sailing ten knots an hour toward our
native land. The captain does not think, on further
reflection, that he can consistently stop at St. Thomas.
We had given up to go if the way had been clear, and
therefore think the hand of the Lord is in it. He will
accept the will for the deed. The cook seems recovering,
and truly penitent. He told me that a testimony
delivered at our last meeting on board was for him.
He has been previously a very profane and wicked
man. This is a fresh instance of the mercy and longsuffering
of the Lord.</p>

<p><em>6th.</em> We are approaching our native land with the
sheaves of peace, but feeling still bound to the work,
not knowing the things that may await us there. May
my whole life be dedicated to His service who has so
remarkably blessed my going out and coming in!</p>

<p><em>20th.</em> The captain concludes to set his course for
Baltimore, hoping to reach Cape Henry before our
stores fail.</p>

<p><em>9th.</em> About ten o'clock a pilot-boat came alongside
and left a pilot. Providence permitting, we may soon
set our feet on the wharf at Baltimore. Soon we must
bid adieu to our home upon the ocean. We are encouraged
with the regular and sober deportment of all
on board, and, though our passage has been a protracted
one, we do not regret it, while we have beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with thankfulness the operation of the Lord's hand
upon the crew of our brave ship, to which, with its
inmates, we shall now bid adieu with emotions of gladness
and regret. Oh may all that have sailed together
here anchor at last in the kingdom of God! Farewell!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after their return Eli Jones wrote an article for
the <cite>Friends' Review</cite> setting forth the conditions of this
African colony, and recommending that some more
work be done to help these enterprising freedmen and
the less enlightened native tribes within the republic
of Liberia. The article was reprinted, and was read
by many. Still later, while at work in North Carolina,
he received a call from the president of the African
Colonization Society to attend one of their meetings
in Washington, which he accordingly did. As he
entered the hall where the exercises were being held
a gentleman was delivering a discourse in which he
endeavored to show the impossibility of an equality
between negroes and white men, and consequently the
hazardousness of the experiment of allowing them to
rule themselves. The chairman then announced that
the next speaker was to have been Eli Jones, but that
he had not yet seen him.</p>

<p>To his surprise, a man rose in the back of the hall,
threw off his overcoat, and came to the platform. He
gave his name as the one called for, and began to give
his knowledge and opinion of Liberian colonization.
He took as his text the remark of the former speaker,
saying that he as a landowner and tiller of the soil
went from Maine to Liberia, where he stood on an
equality with the landowners there; but as he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the presence of President Roberts there was not an
equality, since he, the white man, stood below the vigorous,
wise, strong-minded colored President of the
republic. From that he spoke for an hour feelingly
and emphatically on the excellence of the work going
on in Africa, at the same time impressing the need of
further aid.</p>

<p>Eli and Sybil Jones reached Baltimore in the middle
of winter, and experienced the joy of being once more
among Friends and in their own loved country. Having
been kept and continually supported to accomplish
their work, they now were filled with thanksgiving to
Him whose pillar of cloud and fire had gone before
them by day and by night, and they were prepared in
spirit for the still longer journey which was before
them. They visited friends and relatives on their
way to Maine, and were everywhere joyfully received.
Their children had all passed the time of their absence
pleasantly, and had gained in mental and physical
growth.</p>

<p>It was an interesting sight when their townsmen met
to welcome them home. One can see them in the
monthly meeting, which was held at this time. Many
who came but seldom, rode over the hills that day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sit down on the unpainted seats and listen if they did
not worship, and an unusually large number were
present when the hushed stillness told that meeting
had begun. One father and the mothers of the two
ministers were there, brothers and sisters, uncles and
aunts; many who had always known them, and some
who had never seen them,&mdash;all bowed their heads before
the Mighty One, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line indent4">"Low breathings stole</div>
<div class="line">Of a diviner life from soul to soul,</div>
<div class="line">Baptizing in one tender thought the whole."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Even the cold-hearted felt a warmth steal in, and
the low-spirited were exalted in their minds. No
one who sat under that silence doubted that the
Lord was speaking to "the spirit's finer ear;"
and when the seal was broken and the moved lips
opened in vocal thanksgiving many hearts rose in
harmony. A brief, quiet prayer from a full heart,
when the spirit of the whole meeting rises with it,
reaches where eye cannot see, and comes not back
void. Words are human, but power is divine.</p>

<p>We can see Eli Jones rise from his wonted seat and
slowly speak his text: "When the poor and needy
seek water and there is none, and their tongue faileth
for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of
Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in
high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys.
I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry
land springs of water." His companion sees many
before her who have grown cold while they have been
answering the call from Ethiopia, and sweetly she asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them to whom they will go if they forsake Him who
alone has the words of eternal life. Together they
sound the alarm and call upon their friends and neighbors
to stand firm and quit them like men while they
go out again to reap in other vineyards. At the close
of this day Sybil Jones could say, "He brought us
unto his banqueting-house, and the banner over us
was Love."</p>

<p>Once more they separated from home-friends and
took their little children to West Hill, N. J., the lovely
home of Eliza P. Gurney, who had asked that the two
youngest boys, Eli Grelet and Richard Mott, might be
left with her during their parents' absence.... On
First day they attended the meeting at Burlington, and
sat in company with Stephen Grelet and Richard Mott,
for whom the boys had been named. Stephen Grelet,
that great apostle, who had given messages from the
King of kings to potentates and princes in all the countries
of Europe, who had shown men's equality by holding
his finger to the Pope's extended finger, and who
was now waiting to be ushered into another and a higher
court, addressed them thus: "The Lord has provided
for your children in your absence, and thus given striking
demonstration of His love to you; and now this
testimony is applicable to you, my dear friends: 'I will
be with thee whithersoever thou goest, and will guide
thee with mine eye, and afterward receive thee into
glory;' so go, dear friends, cheerfully, for the Lord
will be your all-sufficient Helper."</p>

<p>After visiting their other children, at Haverford
College and at Providence, they finally sailed from
Boston the 31st of 3d mo. on the steamer "Niagara"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
for Liverpool. A goodly company of Friends from
Lynn and elsewhere were on the wharf to wave them
adieu.</p>

<p>It was an uneventful passage, except that an iceberg
was discovered exactly in their course just in time to
turn the ship from the danger. Sybil Jones writes of
it: "I got on deck while it was in full view, and gazed
with wonder and delight upon this magnificent frosty
traveller from the frigid North to milder skies. It
seemed like an island all of light consolidated into
form, or as a cathedral whose stately spires pierced the
eternal sunshine. The first rays of the morning sun
gave to its pure, spotless whiteness a brilliancy and
beauty that seemed almost of heavenly extraction. It
reminded us of the infinitely more splendid and soul-ravishing
charms of nature's God and heaven's eternal
King, of whose mercy it seemed the white-robed harbinger."</p>

<p>On their return voyage, the ship, sailing at a rapid
rate in a dense fog, found itself almost upon a gigantic
iceberg, a mighty pyramid of ice. It seemed to all on
board that the ship must be crushed. An infidel who
was a fellow-passenger hurried on deck and cried out,
"In an hour we shall all be lost, but let us die like
philosophers."&mdash;"No," said Sybil Jones, rising to her
feet; "if we are to meet death, let us do it as Christians."
In God's goodness all were spared.</p>

<p>They were delighted with their first sight of England,
to find such abundant verdure instead of the snow and ice
which they left on the hills of New England, and they
were more delighted still to find warm hearts waiting
for them, among whom was Benjamin Seebohm, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
had been a former messenger of good to them. It was
nearly time for Dublin yearly meeting to begin, and
they crossed over to Ireland to attend it. This was an
occasion of great interest, and the two American Friends
had weighty service to perform; but Sybil Jones was
taken ill with severe irritation of the spine while the
meeting was still in session. She finally found relief
for that time, and was able to attend some of the meetings.
Their friend Mary James Lecky was always
ready to attend to their comfort, and they did not
want for pleasant homes.</p>

<p>Their visit to Balitore is thus described: "We left
for Balitore in the comfortable coach of our dear friend
Mary J. Lecky. Our route was most pleasant and interesting&mdash;beautiful
groves, rich fields of waving grain,
with herds and flocks scattered over the flowery lawns;
stately dwellings and white cottages, with now and
then some ancient castle in ruins, wearing a vesture of
deep green woven by the evergreen ivy, which flourishes
in rich foliage on its time-beaten walls and dilapidated
towers. The golden furze may be seen in
abundance on hill and dale, and is a lovely ornament
to the variegated scene. The hedges that skirt the
way are bespangled with yellow and crimson primroses,
bluebells, violets, and many other little wild flowers,
forming a radiant wreath entwined with the graceful
ivy. We admired the scene, and talked much of Erin,
the green isle of the ocean. At one o'clock we arrived
at Balitore, or, as it is sometimes called, the 'Classic
Vale.' Dear Elizabeth Barrington&mdash;the 'Princess Elizabeth,'
as she is sometimes called&mdash;gave us a cordial
welcome. The charms of this little village, loveliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the plain, are sweetly enhanced by the memory of
departed worth, talent, genius, virtue and piety which
once flourished here."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Day after day they attended meetings and visited
families, though Sybil Jones was in such a state of
health that it was merely her will which kept her from
bed; she continually spoke of the "frailty of the tabernacle,"
but the strength of the spirit forced the body
to obey and do its part of the work; and as the time
drew near for the London yearly meeting they turned
thither. Everywhere they directed their eyes a new
beauty of landscape, a majesty of mountain, or a charm
of antiquity met them; but Sybil Jones was forced to
close her eyes on all this outward loveliness, and as
as she rode along, reclining on her seat, she comforted
herself "in the presence of Him who verily knows
what is best for us; health and life, with every other
blessing, are in his hand."</p>

<p>The meeting began on the 17th of Fifth month, and
now for the first time in their lives they were sitting in
the parent yearly meeting of the Society of Friends.
For more than two hundred years the Friends of Great
Britain have annually assembled in London, and the
power of these meetings is wonderful. Some of England's
greatest minds have sat in silent waiting there,
and have raised their voices in regard to the proper
ordering of the household of faith, and some of her lowliest
sons and daughters have not been hindered from
sitting in the same seat with these great lights, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
words have been listened to with equal deference.
English conservatism has kept this meeting much as
it was in earlier days, while broad ideas and liberal
notions have been disseminated, so that no stiff cloak
of formalism has settled over the body. The Spirit
which giveth life is sought for, but the iron yoke of
the letter does not rest upon them. The voices of
"just men made perfect" have, in all the generations
since George Fox, pleaded from full hearts that the
Lord might have here a "peculiar people," separated
from the world and satisfied with the one honor of
being "fellow-citizens with the saints."</p>

<p>Eli and Sybil Jones had many comforting sessions
in this meeting, and they not only did the work which
was in their hearts for the strengthening of those assembled,
but they were themselves made more strong
and more useful members of the Church for this work
in the harmonious company of united English Friends.</p>

<p>The effect of their utterances and the impressiveness
of the gathering were beautifully and eloquently described
by Elihu Burritt, who was present, and who
was afterward associated with Eli Jones in the Peace
cause. This passage is from his diary, dated the 21st
of fifth month:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center">
THE QUAKER MEETING.</p>

<p class="head">"<span class="smcap">London</span>, May 21, 1852.
</p>

<p>"This has been a day of deep interest. In the morning
I went to the meeting of public worship in the
Devonshire House, which was filled to the utmost
capacity by Friends from every part of the kingdom.
As a spectacle no human congregation can surpass it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in impressive physiognomy. The immaculate purity
of the women's dresses as they sat a mountain multitude
of shining ones, arising in long quiet ranks from
the floor to the gallery on one side of the house, the
grave mountain of sedate and thoughtful men on the
other, presented an aspect more suggestive of the assemblies
of the New Jerusalem than any earthly congregation
I had ever seen. In a brief time the last-comers
had found seats or standing-places, and then a
deep devotional silence settled down upon the great
assembly like an overshadowing presence from heaven.
The still, upbreathing prayer of a thousand hearts
seemed to ascend like incense, and the communion
of the Holy Spirit to descend like a dove, whispering
its benediction and touching to sweeter listening serenity
those faces so calm with the breath of its wing;
and out of the deep silence of this unspoken devotion
arose one, with trembling meekness, to unburden the
heart of a few brief message-words to which it feared
to withhold utterance, lest it should sin against the
inspiration that made it burn with them. From another
part of the house arose the quavering voice of
prayer, short, but full of the earnest emotion of supplication
and humble utterance of faith and thanksgiving.
Then moments of deeper silence followed, as
if all the faculties of the mind and all the senses of the
physical being had descended into the soul's inner
temple to listen to and wait for the voice of the Spirit
of God. How impressive was the heart-worship of
those silent moments! There was something solemn
beyond description in the spectacle of a thousand
persons of all ages so immovable that they seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
scarcely to breathe. The 'Ministers' Gallery' was
occupied by a long rank of the teachers, the fathers,
and the mothers of the Society from different parts of
the country, who seemed to preside over this communion
like shepherds sitting down before their quiet
flocks by the still waters of salvation. In the centre
sat a man and a woman a little past the meridian of
life, and apparently strangers in the great congregation.
The former had an American look, which was perceptible
even to the opposite extremity of the building,
and when he slowly arose out of the deep silence his
first words confirmed that impression. They were
words fitly spoken and solemn, but uttered with such
a nasal intonation as I never heard before, even in New
England. At first and for a few minutes I felt it doubtful
whether the unpleasant influence of this aggravated
peculiarity would not prevent his words of exhortation
from having salutary effect upon the minds of the listening
assembly. But as his words seemed to flow
and warm with increasing unction, little by little they
cleared up from that nasal cadence and rounded into
more oral enunciation. Little by little they strengthened
with the power of truth, and the truth made them
free and flowing. His whole person, so impassive and
unsympathetic at first, entered into the enunciation of
these truths with constantly increasing animation, and
his address grew more and more impressive to the last.
He spoke nearly an hour, and when he sat down and
buried his fingers under his broad-brimmed hat, and
the congregation settled down into the profound quiet
of serene meditation, I doubted whether it would be
broken again by the voice of another exhortation. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in the course of a few minutes the form of the woman
who sat by his side&mdash;and it was his wife&mdash;might be
perceived in a state of half-suppressed emotion, as if
demurring to the inward monitor of the Spirit that
bade her arise and speak to such an assembly. It
might well have seemed formidable to the nature of
a meek and delicate woman. She seemed to struggle
involuntarily with the conviction of duty, and to incline
her person slightly toward her husband, as if the tried
attributes of her heart leaned for strength on the sympathy
of his, as well as on the wisdom she waited from
above. Then she arose calm, meek, and graceful. Her
first words dropped with the sweetest enunciation upon
the still congregation, and were heard in every part of
the house, though they were uttered in a tone seemingly
but little above a whisper. Each succeeding
sentence warbled into new beauty and fulness of silvery
cadence. The burden of her spirit was the life of
religion in the heart as contrasted with its mere language
on the tongue, or what it was to be really and
truly a disciple of Jesus Christ. Having meekly stated
the subject which had occupied her meditations and
which she had felt constrained to revive in the hearing
of the congregation before her, she said: 'And now,
in my simple way and in the brief words which may
be given me, let me enter with you into the examination
of this question.' At the first word of this sentence
she loosed the fastenings of her bonnet, and at
the last handed it down to her husband with a grace
indescribable. There was something very impressive
in the act as well as in the manner in which it was
performed, as if she uncovered her head involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in reverence to that vision of divine truth unsealed to
her waiting eyes. And in her eyes it seemed to beam
with a heavenly light serene, and in her heart to burn
with holy inspiration and meekness, and to touch her
lips and every gentle movement of her person with an
expression eloquent, solemn, beautiful as her words fell
upon the rapt assembly from the heaven of tremulous
flute-like music with which her voice filled the building.
Like a stream welling from Mount Hermon and
winding its way to the sea, so flowed the melodious
current of her message, now meandering among the
unopened flowers of rhymeless poetry, now through
green pastures of salvation, where the Good Shepherd
was bearing in his bosom the tender lambs of his flock;
next it took the force of lofty diction, and fell, as it
were, in cascades of silvery eloquence, but solemn,
slow, and searching, adown the rocks and ravines of
Sinai; then out like a sweet-rolling river of music into
the wilderness, where the Prodigal Son, with the husks
of his poverty clutched in his lean hands, sat in tearful
meditation upon his father's home and his father's love.
More than a thousand persons seemed to hold their
breath as they listened to that meek, delicate woman,
whose lips appeared to be touched to an utterance
almost divine. I never saw an assembly so moved,
but so subdued into motionless meditation. And the
serene and solemn silence deepened to stillness more
profound when she ceased speaking. In the midst of
these still moments she knelt in prayer. As the first
word of her supplication arose the men, who had worn
their hats while she spoke to them, reverently uncovered
their heads as she kneeled to speak to God. Long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
fervent was her supplication. Her clear sweet voice
trembled with the burden of the petition with which
her soul seemed to ascend into the Holy of holies,
and to plead there with Jacob's Father for a blessing
upon all encircled within that immediate presence.
She arose from her knees, and the great congregation
sat down, as it were under the shadow of that prayer
to silence more deep and devotional. This lasted a
few minutes, when two elders of the Society, seated in
the centre of the 'Ministers' Gallery,' shook hands
with each other, and were followed by other couples
in each direction as a kind of mutual benediction as
well as a signal that meeting was terminated.&mdash;At this
simple sign the whole congregation arose and quietly
left the house. Such was the experience of a couple
of hours in a Quaker meeting."</p></blockquote>

<p>The last day of the yearly meeting Sybil Jones
spoke out her feelings in regard to total abstinence.
She was probably the first person who publicly stated
to an English audience the necessity of taking such
high ground to overcome the evils of intemperance,
and, though much sympathy was expressed, there was
a deep feeling on the part of some against her expressed
views. She writes: "This day has concluded
the yearly meeting; my spirit was bound down under
a weight of exercise, but divine help came and enabled
me to testify the gospel of the grace of God in a way
most humiliating to the creature; but some, it may be
hoped, were led to examine how far their example of
righteousness and temperance had reached to give a
check to the crying sin of this nation, that not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
their husbands and brothers be influenced by their
example, but also their neighbors, and whether there
was not something for them to do in this matter, even
total abstinence if it may be required. When this was
done my peace abounded, and I hope no harm was
done. Many dear Friends seemed to feel much sympathy,
and a precious solemnity came over us."</p>

<p>For weeks after leaving London these "two recruiting-officers
labored hard to enlist soldiers for their
Captain" through the northern counties of Ireland.
Not only Friends and other Protestants came to hear
them, but often there were priests present at the meetings,
and many Irish Catholics heard them preach the
gospel. Sometimes Sybil Jones seemed to be "standing
on the verge of eternity," but as the body grew frail
it seemed the soul waxed strong and her messages became
more impressive. All she saw as they rode from
one village to another attracted her attention, and she
rejoiced that the Creator had made the earth so fair,
while she was brought into great sadness at the poverty
and oppression of the unfortunate, and the lack of vital
religion which was often found. There was great need
of wisdom in telling the whole truth to her mixed
audiences, to have it come to them as the one thing
they needed to make their unhappy lives happy, and
her soul went out in her utterances to their souls and
stirred them to believe. There was hardly a town
which they visited where error had not been taught
and superstitions ruled the hearts of the people, and
many who had suffered deep wrongs felt that there
was no justice in the earth. To such it was announced,
"Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
upright in heart;" but they felt that "nothing short of
the omnipotent Arm could deliver these souls from
popish thraldom and make them free through the
power of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>Mary James Lecky continued to accompany them,
and she was an almost indispensable companion, providing
for their comfort and safety and opening ways
for their service which to them alone would have been
closed; and as Sybil Jones was under a daily weight
of infirmity, she was a strong arm to lean upon, and
encouraged her as a sister when her heart grew weak
from the abundance of trial.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>A few passages from their journal will tell much of
their earnest efforts and ceaseless longings to help this
people, and also the difficulties with which they were
beset. At Galway, once a famous seaport town on the
west coast of Ireland, they write:</p>

<p>"<em>9th mo. 15th.</em> Called at an early hour upon the vicar,
an Episcopal clergyman, D'Arcy, who attended our
meeting and kindly invited us to come to his residence
and he would take us to the school and make way for
any religious service to which we felt called. He received
us heartily and entered into the plans we wished
to execute. He accompanied us, with his amiable wife,
to the asylum for aged females and to the school. We
had service for Him who sent us, much to our comfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and, we may trust, to their edification. The dear
children listened with delight and interest to all that
was offered, and many appeared tender. They are
improving finely and getting a good knowledge of the
Scriptures, which may be of lasting benefit to them;
but oh the hunger and rags were apparent enough to
pain the hardest heart. Our company distributed
some relief among them as seemed most prudent; the
evil might be wholly remedied by giving them work
and a fair compensation. The Irish are not naturally
idle; there is abundant proof to the contrary.</p>

<p>"<em>16th, Fifth day.</em> This morning visited the poor-house
and school connected with it; all neat and orderly,
good improvement; about thirteen hundred inmates.
We had the children collected for religious service,
and it was a good time. They were mostly Roman
Catholics. They were serious and seemed contrited."</p>

<p>"<em>17th.</em> Two friends with my Eli called on the Roman
priest and informed him of our intention to hold a
meeting for the inhabitants; he was civil, but said
none of his people would attend."</p>

<p>At another time, while they were in the city of Galway,
Eli Jones was told that he would be stoned by
the Catholics if he attempted to preach. He at once
called on the priest, told him that he was an American,
and obtained a promise from him that his people should
be allowed to come to the meeting that evening. Before
a large audience of the most bigoted Roman
Catholics he arose to preach the gospel of redeeming
love. It was the part of wisdom to gain his hearers,
for their souls could not be reached until the barrier
of their prejudice was broken down. He began: "A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son, and his name
shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God,
The Everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace;"
"Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee,
blessed art thou among women;" "They found Joseph
and Mary and the babe." After hearing these passages
they were all ready to listen to him, and then, as he says,
"I soon left the <em>mother</em> and talked to them of the <em>child</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>The 20th, at Conamarra.</em> People mostly in rags
worn to strings, winter near, hunger everywhere; but
a better time is coming, we hope. They seem emerging
from the shades of superstition and moral darkness,
having seen in some degree the light which enlightened
the Gentiles and the glory of Israel. May the bright
and morning Star shine in its resplendent beauty over
this neglected land! May the labors of the faithful
ministers of Christ be more abundant and their service
for Him be crowned with cheering success! and may
the seed sown, though often with weeping, trembling,
and much fear, bring forth an hundred-fold!</p>

<p>"<em>21st.</em> We arrived at Clifden in time for a meeting
held in a courthouse. Many sober people came who
seemed glad to hear of the way of life, but others,
set on by the priests, disturbed the meeting, so that it
was not a very comfortable time; but I secretly rejoiced
in being counted worthy to suffer for His name's
sake who sent us forth."</p>

<p>On the 28th Sybil Jones was taken very ill with influenza.
They were fortunately at Kilnock, among
very kind friends. Here they were kept nearly a
month. Eli Jones improved all the time, holding
meetings almost continually, while his wife, confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to her room, "was in great peace" and the triumphal
anthem was on her lips:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">"If Thou shouldst call me to resign</div>
<div class="line">What most I prize&mdash;it ne'er was mine&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">I only yield Thee what was Thine;</div>
<div class="line">Thy will be done."</div>
</div></div>

<p>After six weeks, nearly all of which had been weeks
of illness and hence time taken from the work, she
writes: "I like to note now and then the fleet footsteps
of Time. I perceive he will not stay his rapid
course for me, and therefore I most earnestly pray so
to number my days and to apply my heart with diligence
unto wisdom that each golden hour may bear
upward the incense of a grateful, devotional spirit still
more and more dedicated to the work and service, of
so vast and infinite importance, that my heavenly Father
has assigned to His poor, unworthy child, and that the
holy discipline of the cross of Christ may nurture and
increase every grace of the eternal quickening Spirit of
my dear Redeemer. While the truth is indelibly stamped
upon my spirit that I can do nothing without Him, I
believe 'I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth
me.' May these afflictions of the shattered citadel,
which now confine me to a lonely room and often a
sleepless couch, be sanctified to the promotion of
righteousness and true holiness in myself and others,
that in every dispensation thanksgiving may arise to
the blessed name of the Lord!"</p>

<p>Near Lisburn she was again a prisoner from sickness
for about four weeks, and earnestly she prayed for
guidance and strength to bear whatever came for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>The 30th of 1st mo., 1853</em>. I think I have seen, by
the light that has never yet deceived me, my path
across the Channel to Liverpool&mdash;that if I trust in my
Saviour alone for bodily and spiritual strength, it will
be accomplished and marvellous deliverance wrought.
This morning I mentioned my prospect to my dear
husband of a speedy release from this place. He
seemed doubtful of its practicability with safety to my
health. I replied, 'Nothing is impossible with God.
I believe He will bring us through this Jordan.' We
thought of Third day, as a steamer would sail at 4 <small>P. M.</small>,
but it did not seem clear, and I was thrown into doubting
and fear. After seeking divine direction I felt a
blessed trust that on Fifth day we might with safety
leave these shores.</p>

<p>"<em>Third day.</em> My dear Eli mentioned a prospect of
a public meeting at Carrickfergus, and this was a
confirmation that our plan was right."</p>

<p>On Fourth day they held a farewell meeting, and
there was much expression of mutual love, and, the
Irish Friends gave thanks for the long service which
had been performed in their land. For almost a year
the gospel had been preached over the island to high
and low, to rich and poor. Eli Jones visited, with perhaps
one exception, every meeting in Ireland, and met
personally some members of nearly every Friend's
family on the island. No suffering or other hindrance
had kept these two servants from sowing seed in all
kinds of soil, and they came from the field believing
that their sowing would bring forth fruit after many
days. Sybil Jones went to her train on a couch, and was
obliged to make the whole journey to Liverpool in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
same way, but she was soon at work again at Manchester.
Here she rested while Eli Jones visited the
surrounding meetings, and the prospect of still more
extended work began to appear to them. Certainly,
few laborers have gone out in a more determined spirit
to overcome all obstacles to carry the gladdest of all
news to ears as yet ungladdened by it. They visited
the quarterly meetings at York, Leeds, Lancaster,
Darlington, and Birmingham, and Sybil Jones rested
while Eli attended Dublin yearly meeting. She was
visited by Harriet Beecher Stowe, and they had a time
of prayer together. There were many interesting incidents
connected with their visits at the different cities
and the various homes. Joseph Sturge came to talk
with them of temperance and slavery, and told them
he intended to contribute to the support of New Garden
Boarding-school, where some of the children of
the South might have the privilege of gaining better
knowledge.</p>

<h3><em>NORWAY, GERMANY, AND SWITZERLAND.</em></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">And lo! all other voices far and near</div>
<div class="line">Died at that whisper full of meanings clear."</div>

</div></div>


<p>Eli and Sybil Jones attended the London yearly
meeting of 1853, and were liberated to go to the Continent
for gospel work in Norway, Germany, and
France. Mary James Lecky was their companion,
and was in all respects a most suitable person for this
service. Unknown difficulties were before them; new
races of people were to be touched through an unknown
language; hard journeys were to be made by
a feeble, almost invalid woman; still, they turned
toward the shores of Norway, believing that He
whose finger pointed the way would shield them
with His hand. Once more they unquestioningly
gave immediate obedience to the word of their great
Captain, and they knew His ways well enough to
be assured that the result would be the desired
one.</p>

<p>Joseph Crosfield offered to go as a caretaker for the
little party, and he was of great help to them. When
they arrived at Liverpool from Ireland, an elderly
doctor was called to see Sybil Jones. After examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
her trouble carefully, he said, "You know David
had it in his heart to build the Lord an house. In
his case the will was taken for the work; so it must
be in yours. You must stop your work and go south,
or go to your home at once." If this doctor had followed
his patient, he would have found her in the
northern latitude of Norway. The great Physician's
order conflicted with that of the doctor, and there
could be no doubt which was to be followed.</p>

<p>On the 11th of 6th month they embarked on the
steamer "Courier" for Christiansand, being joined
by James Backhouse and Lindley M. Hoag, making
a company of six. The passage was very rough, and
all on board were brought low with sea-sickness, but
the German Ocean was soon crossed, and they came
into port at Christiansand, finding it light enough at
midnight to read and write and to see the beautiful
Norwegian scenery around them.</p>

<p>The western coast of Norway is everywhere indented
by arms of the sea called fiords; the coasts
are rough and rugged, overhung with crags of rock
beaten and worn by the age-long dash of these northern
waters. Into these fiords has rushed the ship of
many a bold seaman, and the shores are tilled by a
hardy race, carrying in their veins the civilized blood
of the old Norse warrior. These descendants of
Northern mythology rejoice when messengers come
to tell the simple way of life and joy through the
Saviour, and their boats are ready to bear strangers
from one promontory across the fiord to another.
They come in crowds to hear of the better way, and
yet in many places they have escaped the thraldom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Thor and Odin only to bow their necks to the yoke
which the priests make them bear.</p>

<p>"There are many flourishing towns and villages
pleasantly situated on the fiords, easily accessible by
boat. The scenery is grand and picturesque&mdash;lofty
mountains, verdant lawns, and flowery vales, with now
and then a beautiful cascade or mountain-torrent rushing
and mingling its snow-white foam with the crystal
waters below. Formerly the Friends' meeting was held
at Stavanger Fiord, but there were numerous Friends
scattered along the coast.</p>

<p>"<em>6th mo. 25, 1853.</em> This day the Norway yearly meeting
commenced at ten o'clock. A deep solemnity
came over us. A few words with life and feeling from
dear Mary J. Lecky opened the way for L. M. Hoag,
who testified the gospel of the grace of God to a deeply
interested assembly. In the afternoon we assembled
for business, which was conducted under a good influence
and very orderly. The subject of addressing
King Oscar on account of the suffering of some of the
members by the exaction of tithes was discussed and
referred to a committee. Two persons were received
into membership, and two more applied. The certificates
of ministers present were read, after which several
lively testimonies were borne and counsel offered, and
all ended well."</p>

<p>When the yearly meeting was finished the Friends
held meetings with the prisoners and visited the different
schools, holding meetings also at their hotels
and once or twice in a barn. They went as far north
as Bergen, where they had remarkable assemblies of
people notwithstanding the fact that the priests spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the report that these Quakers were dangerous people
and did not believe in God. They were refused permission
to visit the prisoners; however, they sent
Bibles and tracts to them, not being allowed to distribute
them in person. The inhabitants of Bergen
were highly displeased at the conduct of the ecclesiastics,
and it seemed that many more came to hear
the Friends for themselves on account of the unchristian
spirit which was manifested toward them, and
numbers came to their hotel to be instructed. It was
very touching to their tender spirits to see an eagerness
for better things so crushed out by so-called
teachers. "The flock look up and are not fed." Having
done what they could, they returned to Stavanger,
and spent much time visiting families and holding
public meetings. When they took the boat to leave
this place the people wished they would send them
more "good bodies" to teach them.</p>

<p>They travelled all the way from Stavanger to Christiansand,
a distance of ninety-four miles, in an open
boat, walking across the isthmuses from one fiord to
another and carrying the boat over with them. From
Christiansand they went by boat to Christiania, where
they had a meeting with the seamen, besides other public
meetings, all well attended. Then they prepared
to leave Norway for Kiel, Denmark, on their way to
Germany, having travelled twelve hundred miles in
Norway, mostly by boat, and having held fifty meetings,
besides visiting many families; in all of which
work they were wonderfully helped with strength,
and the Spirit of the Lord was with them.</p>

<p>The 16th of 7th month they left Norway, bound for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Denmark. They sailed down by Jutland and entered
the Cattegat. Along the shores they saw "highly-cultivated
fields of grain, white for harvest, shepherds
keeping their flocks beside the meandering streams,
reposing beneath the shade, while the sheep were
feeding in green pastures, which were interspersed
with neat red-roofed cottages."</p>

<p>They went directly to Minden, where most of the
few German Friends live, who, unfortunately, are becoming
fewer and fewer. After visiting these families
and attending their mid-week meeting, they rode to
Oberkirchen in Hesse. "Soon after reaching our
hotel," they write, "we were visited by the police, who
inquired our business, telling us we could not be
allowed to hold any public meetings in the place&mdash;that
it would be contrary to the law to allow any dissenter
from the Lutheran Church to hold a meeting.
We informed them we had no such purpose, but came
to visit those who had left the public worship and professed
with us. They then withdrew, appearing quite
ashamed of their business; but after coffee, when we
were engaged in prayer, they again appeared, telling
us that if we intended to have a public meeting they
must request us to leave the place. We told them
again our intention, and they took our names and
withdrew. We asked our landlord why peaceable
American citizens were molested by the police and
their business inquired into, assuring him that it was
the first time in all our travels in various countries
that we had been remanded before the authorities&mdash;that
many of their countrymen came unmolested to
our country and were treated civilly. He replied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the conduct of the police had highly displeased him,
and on inquiring into the cause of it he found that the
priests had sent them."</p>

<p>From Minden, Eli and Sybil Jones went on to
Pyrmont, where they attended the "two-months"
meeting. They held a public meeting in the Friends'
house, and some people of note came to hear them.
One, a Russian noble of high birth; Dr. Menke, one
of the privy council of the prince of Waldeck, who
was said to be one of the most learned men in Prussia;
also Frederick Fickenscher, the son of the dean of
Nuremberg; besides many Jews, all of whom heard
"Jesus Christ, and Him crucified," preached.</p>

<p>Eli Jones had some opportunities for conversation
with Fickenscher, and he impressed on him the importance
of our opinions in regard to war, oaths, and
other subjects, and he was urged to accept the gospel
in all its fulness. Dr. Menke came to express to them
his satisfaction with the meeting, saying that he <em>had</em>
thought that the views of Friends were rather <em>fabulous</em>,
but he was now satisfied that they were evangelical,
and he hoped what he had heard would be useful to
him. They revisited Minden, and had much service
among Friends and others, both publicly and in private.
They held a large meeting in the Minden
theatre, of which Eli Jones writes: "A full attendance,
several clergymen present. Some Friends seemed
to doubt the propriety of holding a meeting in a building
usually applied to theatrical purposes; but, to my
mind, there was a fitness in the place, that we might
have an opportunity to speak to a class which we could
hardly reach anywhere else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>From Minden they journeyed by short stages south,
stopping at Düsseldorf, where they visited the schools
and charity institution; at Cologne, Bonn, Strasbourg,
Basle. In Basle they held a meeting with sixty young
men, students at the Basle mission-house, who were
looking forward to becoming missionaries in the different
parts of the world. A fellow-feeling led them to
point these young men to the words of the Lord:
"Without me ye can do nothing." They then took a
carriage, going as far as the Lake of Geneva. It was
so arranged that Sybil Jones could recline, being then
far from well.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones writes:</p>

<p>"<em>10th mo. 8th.</em> This morning set off for Geneva by
steamboat from Vevay. It being near the head of the
lake, our starting-point was delightful, and our trip on
the fair blue water interesting amid the grand mountains
which encircle the lake. They rise like vast
battlements above the clouds in some places. Mont
Blanc, the monarch of mountains, was pointed out.
We arrived at the ancient, interesting city of Geneva
about four o'clock. From our room at the Hôtel du
Rhône we have a fine view of the Rhone, which leaves
the lake a few yards above and dashes by our windows,
washing the basement story with its blue waters, hastening
on to mingle with the great Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"<em>9th.</em> The work never seemed more weighty and
watchfulness and prayer more needful. Our company
attended a meeting held by Merle d'Aubigné, the author
of the <cite>History of the Reformation</cite>. He made a report
of the proceedings of the Evangelical Alliance held at
Berlin, giving interesting information of the state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
feeling existing between the different religious denominations
on the Continent, who find themselves more
in unison than formerly.</p>

<p>"<em>11th.</em> Held a large meeting in the Casino. The
Lord was with us. Dear Christine Alsop interprets
well; indeed, we lack nothing.</p>

<p>"<em>12th.</em> To-day several serious persons have called,
with whom we have had very interesting conversations
about the things which appertain to eternal life. A
very agreeable person came to offer his thanks for the
privilege of the meeting, adding, 'I think it will do
good, for I have been examining the Epistle of Paul,
and I am certain he did not mean to forbid a woman's
preaching the glad tidings of a risen Saviour, but rather
counselled the women not to be asking improper questions
in their church-meetings nor to exercise authority
or teach in the matter of church discipline; for it is
plain that holy women of old <em>did</em> prophesy (that is,
preach), and that Paul did not attempt to hinder them.
He also informed us that a philosophical deist was
present last evening whom he had never seen at a
religious meeting before, and that he fully expected
that he would turn it all into ridicule, but, to his
astonishment, he looked serious and said, 'I never
heard anything like this; I scarcely know what to
say. It was surely an interesting discourse.' So we
do indeed see that God sometimes chooses 'the weak
things of this world to confound the mighty.' We
were informed that many came who were never seen
at meetings on ordinary occasions. Attended another
meeting at the 'Locale,' which was sweet and refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>13th.</em> Some pious persons have called, among them
a very devoted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteur</i> with his daughter, whose name
is Lalia. They called just as we were seated for reading
the Scriptures, and joined us. During the silence
I felt the spirit of supplication, but it seemed not to
belong to me to pray vocally, and I said that if any
person felt it a duty to pray I hoped that he would be
faithful. Unknown to me, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteur</i> had just asked
C. Alsop in French if there was liberty; she replied in
my words. It was a precious season of prayer and
praise. In the evening we attended an appointment
for youth and children. It was large and solemn, and
I reverently trust Christ was preached.</p>

<p>"<em>14th.</em> The interest of the people in our meetings
still increases, and many inquirers come to see us,
thanking us for the privilege and asking if there will
be more meetings. Jane Bingham and sister, with
Maria Ferris, arrived to-day from Montreux, not having
heard of our meetings until we had left. They
are Friends from England; it was pleasant to meet
them. A female superintendent and teacher of young
ladies called and took tea, and seemed very devoted to
the cause of her Redeemer. She follows this business
not for gain to herself, but for gain to others. Her
pupils are occupying prominent places, adorned with
wisdom and virtue.</p>

<p>"<em>15th.</em> Robert Fox, son, and daughter arrived to-day
and took lodgings with us. Our party numbers
twelve. It is pleasant to meet these dear friends while
on a tour for their health. We took a short ride this
morning in a carriage provided by dear M. J. L. to the
country-seat of the Count de Selon, who was an ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
advocate of peace. In the grounds is an obelisk raised
over his remains, with interesting inscriptions on the
subject of peace. We hope his faithful labors may
not be lost. From this beautiful place we had a fine
view of Mont Blanc at sunset; which was magnificent.
The snows of ages changed to crimson; the
beautiful azure lake and the fine city of Geneva lay
in loveliness before us.</p>

<p>"<em>16th.</em> To-day held two precious meetings at our
hotel, to which a number of serious people came, and
expressed themselves especially pleased with the <em>silence</em>,
saying that it was needed in these times of commotion.</p>

<p>"<em>17th.</em> Returned by steamer to Lausanne. Took
lodgings at a hotel which is on the spot where Gibbon
wrote his celebrated <cite>History of the Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire</cite>. Had meeting of much interest;
many <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteurs</i> present. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteur</i> full of the spirit
of peace informed us that many who had preached
against war in Lausanne had suffered imprisonment.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteur</i> wished us to go to Lyons and preach two
such sermons there, saying that they were needed. He
did not understand that we could not preach except
we were sent, nor give forth anything but what we
receive at the time.</p>

<p>"Took steamer for Vevay; dined at the hotel, and
in the evening held a meeting in the Casino, after
which we rode to Montreux and took lodgings at a
<em>pension</em>. Next day held a large meeting at the national
place of worship called the 'Temple.' It was a
solemn and instructive convocation. The forenoon
was occupied in a pleasant walk by the lake at the foot
of a mountain, on the side of which stands the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and old chapel of Montreux; on the left and before us
the ancient castle of Chillon, and the Dent du Midi
Mountain covered with snow. On the right lay the
lovely lake, on the other side of which rises a majestic
range of mountains. I became weary of walking, and
we called at a mansion just on the border of the lake.
The master is a young Jew, and of a very tender
Christian spirit. We had delightful conversation with
him on heavenly things. He had attended one of our
meetings, and was much struck with our manner of
worship. He said that when we began to speak
(Christine and myself) he imagined we had composed
the discourse and committed it to memory, but soon
he perceived the interpreter made a mistake, which
rather puzzled him, and another mistake convinced
him that she could not have known what I was to
say previously. Indeed, he thought it was spoken so
rapidly it must come from the heart as it was uttered.
He was much edified, and spoke of those solemn truths
with great diffidence and tenderness. His name is
Samuel Samelson. May Israel's gentle Shepherd lead
him to the blessed knowledge of the truth as it is in
Jesus and enable him to confess Him before men! Our
young friend provided me with a donkey, which conveyed
me to the residence of the Hustlers, who have
resided here some time. They were formerly English
Friends, and received us with joy. The wife is in very
delicate health. We sat together in sweet heavenly
silence, and the language of the Spirit through the
poor instrument was encouraging and humbling. Returned
on the donkey by a shorter route on the side
of the mountain. My heart responded to the music of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
birds and the smile of Nature. After dining we took
a drive to Chillon, the ancient château where Bonnivard
was imprisoned on account of his political views for
several years. The château stands in the lake. Within
it is a range of dungeons below the surface of the
water where prisoners of state and the condemned are
confined. Across one of the vaults is a beam black
with age where the executions took place. It is said
two thousand Jews perished here by the hands of
enemies. As we viewed these walls and sombre apartments
we were struck by a sense of man's inhumanity
to man and the rapid flight of events so momentous.
How long, O Lord, ere thou takest unto thyself the
great power and reignest?</p>

<p>"<em>22d.</em> Called on a bereaved father and mother who
were mourning the death of an only child. We told
them of Him who wounds that He may heal. We
also visited a widow and her daughter who knew dear
Stephen Grelet, and remembered his heart-searching
ministry among them. Pasteur Godet was with us a
short time. He is a pious, humble Christian from
Neufchatel, who has left the honors of the world (he
had been tutor of the king of Prussia), a man of learning
and talent; which qualities seem sweetly sanctified.
At two o'clock <small>P. M.</small> attended a youths' meeting.</p>

<p>"<em>23d.</em> A meeting was held at the Hustlers', which
our party attended, but I was quite ill in bed, but reposing
in Him who is my only source of joy.</p>

<p>"<em>24th.</em> Not able to proceed. Dined in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</i>,
and with a grateful heart was able to return thanks
vocally, which seemed to impress the large company
with a serious air. After dining, several spoke to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
kindly, among whom was a baroness from Sweden,
who warmly pressed us to go thither, saying there
were many in Sweden who would receive us warmly,
and her own house should be at our disposal for a
home. Invited the family and boarders to our evening
reading. Much tenderness was shown. Many have
called on us and expressed their gratitude for our visit
and gospel labors among them. We are sweetly united
to a living seed in this land.</p>

<p>"<em>25th.</em> Took our departure from this highly interesting
field of labor after an affectionate parting. We
took the omnibus to Villeneuve and found the steamer
ready. After passing the most magnificent scenery
we were soon again at Lausanne. Made arrangements
for a meeting next day.</p>

<p>"<em>26th.</em> In the morning held a meeting with the prisoners
in the beautiful prison here. I think it the finest
and most comfortable I have ever seen in any land.
Our visit was deeply interesting, and the poor girls
were nearly all in tears, and seemed truly grateful for
the message of love to them. In the evening held a
large and favored meeting at the Casino. Our boat
was detained by the dense fog, so we were obliged to
remain another day, which seemed providential, as a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteur</i> called and told us of two Moravian schools
taught by pasteurs, one of whom had expressed regret
at not hearing of our meeting or not seeing us. He
offered to accompany us to one of the schools. C.
Alsop, our interpreter, had gone to visit an acquaintance,
so Mary Millman, a sweet-tempered girl who
spoke English well and who accompanied us, acted as
interpreter. The kind pasteur received us cordially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and offered to assemble the girls; which was agreeable
to us. I think we have seldom known a more heavenly
season. The Lord poured out a rich blessing upon us.
We returned with songs of praise to our hotel. Have
had many calls to-day from Christian brothers and
sisters, expressing their interest in our labors among
them. A very zealous person called who spoke with
much tenderness of J. and M. Yardly, who were instrumental
in her conversion. Held a meeting in the
evening which was much blest.</p>

<p>"<em>28th.</em> Set off early this morning to visit the Moravian
school for boys, taking the same kind interpreter
with us. We received a hearty welcome, and were
informed that the boys had just assembled to commence
Scripture history, and that if we could feel
something good to say to them they would be so glad.
Dear E. replied that we came for that purpose. We
were soon seated in a pleasant youthful congregation.
Some countenances testified that they had been with
Jesus. The pasteur read a chapter; solemn silence
ensued, then a gentle shower of gospel love descended
and the little plants revived. I cannot doubt but there
are young men in this institution who will fill important
places of usefulness, perhaps ministers of the gospel
who will publish the glad tidings to lands remote.
Surely such men, fearing God, are much needed in this
degenerate age. The pasteur offered a sweet-spirited
prayer with tears of gratitude, and we came away.
Reached the steamer in good time. We feel much fellowship
with many dear friends in Lausanne. Arrived at
Geneva, and, concluding to go on to Lyons at once, we
had to sacrifice our desires to see the dear friends again."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3><em>WINTER IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.</em></h3>


<p>Before going on to speak of the work of Eli and
Sybil Jones among the Friends and other Protestants
in the south of France, a brief sketch of the rise and
growth of the little branch of our Society there may
be in place. The story is full of interest and could be
studied to greater length with profit, but only the
briefest reference to it is admissible here.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. of France decided in 1685 to revoke the
"Edict of Nantes," passed in 1598 by Henry of Navarre,
granting liberty of worship and repose to all
parties in the Church. The revocation was the most
cruel order ever issued by any king. It commanded
the demolition of all the Protestant chapels that remained
standing, and forbade any assembly or worship;
all opposing ministers were ordered to leave the
kingdom within fifteen days; the schools were closed;
all newborn babes were to be baptized by the parish
priests; evangelical religionists were forbidden to leave
the kingdom, on pain of the galleys for men and confiscation
of person and property for women. It is
calculated that six hundred thousand Protestants left
France during the twenty years following the revocation,
while many suffered cruel deaths and many others
spent their lives in the galley-ships. The great struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
made against this royal edict was along the Cévenne
Mountains in the departments of Lozère, Drôme, Ardèche,
Gard, and Hèrault. The Protestants were called
Camisards, perhaps from the word <em>camisarde</em>, a night-attack,
but its origin is unsettled. Many of the ministers
in Cévenne had been executed, and enthusiasm
was raised to the highest pitch. Deprived of their
pastors, men, women, boys, and girls became animated
by the spirit of prophecy. "Young girls had celestial
visions; the little peasant-lasses poured out their utterances
in French, sometimes in the language and with
the sublime eloquence of the Bible." They assembled
under the name of "Children of God," and marched
commanded by two chiefs, Roland and Cavalier. The
insurrection was widespread, and for a long time they
overcame or evaded the royal troops. "The Lord of
hosts is our strength!" said one prophet. "We will
intone the battle-psalms, and from the Lozère to the
sea Israel shall arise."</p>

<p>They are thus pictured by a contemporary sent to
deal with them: "They are stark mad on the subject
of religion, absolutely intractable on that point; the
first little boy or girl that falls a-trembling and declares
that the Holy Spirit is speaking to it, all the people
believe it, and if God and all his angels were to come
and speak to them they would not believe them any
more; they walk to execution singing the praises of
God and exhorting those present, insomuch that it has
been necessary to surround the criminals with drums
to prevent the pernicious effect of their speeches." No
men and women were ever more in earnest or filled
with more zeal, but it was often a misguided zeal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the cause was dishonored by fearful bloodshed. Their
camp was named the "Camp of the Eternal," and they
marched to battle singing the grand version of the
68th Psalm, "Que Dieu se monte seulement." Among
them were many who were sincere, many on whom
the Spirit rested, and there was a grand principle animating
them. Much that seems so excessive may be
excused on the consideration that they were driven to
fury by persecution and they bore in their veins the
hot blood of a southern race.</p>

<p>How the little company of peace-loving Friends
came from these <em>Camisards</em>, these <em>Children of God</em>, has
been a question. There is a manuscript still in existence
of a letter supposed to have been written by
some pastors of Geneva which was received and circulated
through the Cévenne. It was an appeal for
these struggling brethren to throw away the sword
and cease from bloodshed. "It must be the Lord's
arm," it goes on to say, "and not yours, which shall
put an end to your captivity. Do all you can to
obtain the desired object by a holy life, and not by
the works of darkness."</p>

<p>After receiving this letter there was some abatement
from their accustomed acts of cruelty. Among those
who claimed the gift of prophecy was a young woman
named Lucretia. Her influence over the people excited
the jealousy of the leaders. When they attempted
to silence her she called out, "Let those who love me
follow me." Many followed her, and her house became
a place for meetings. From this company, it has been
said, the Friends in Congènies are descended. The
author has seen a wine-cellar at Fontanés, in the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of Samuel Brun, where these Friends met for many
years. The walls were lined on the inside with wine-casks
to keep the sound from going out, and Samuel
Brun has in his possession a large Bible which for a
generation was built into the wall of the building.
Everything which has been recorded shows the sincerity
and quiet determination of these people to worship
God as the New Testament required. Year after
year they took their flocks out on the hills or tilled
the more gentle slopes of the mountains, and they
never forgot to meet in their secluded vault to praise
God together for the blessings which He gave them.
There was a tower of Constance at Aiguesmontes of
terrible repute, but they were undaunted and possessed
"the brave old wisdom of sincerity."</p>

<p>And this is how they became known to their brother
Friends, as is told in a tract compiled by Friends at
Manchester, England: "In the struggle for independence
in 1776 the American colonies received sympathy
and aid from France. There was at that time living
at Falmouth a surgeon named Joseph Fox, a member
of the Society of Friends, who both by education and
conviction regarded war in every shape as forbidden
by the gospel. He was part owner of the 'Greyhound'
and the 'Brilliant,' two cutters which traded
along the Cornish coast. The other owners of the
cutters decided to fit them out with license to waylay
and capture merchant-vessels of the enemy. Joseph
Fox of course protested. Being one alone, his protest
was disregarded and the vessels were armed. The war
broke out so unexpectedly that many French crafts fell
an easy prey to the English cruisers, and the 'Greyhound'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and 'Brilliant' succeeded in capturing two
valuable merchantmen, together with some small
coasting-vessels. Joseph Fox believed it to be his
Christian duty to claim his share and hold it in trust
to be restored to the rightful owners. In 1783 peace
was restored, and the next year Joseph Fox sent his
son, Dr. Edward Fox, to Paris to advertise for the
owners of the plundered property. A proceeding so
unheard of was naturally looked upon with suspicion,
and before the doctor could obtain leave to insert his
advertisement in the <cite>Gazette</cite> he had to communicate
with the Count de Vergennes, one of the French
ministry, who required a formal declaration that his
real object was such as it professed to be.</p>

<p>Meantime, Joseph Fox died. In consequence of the
public notice application was made by numerous parties;
all the claims were proved to be well founded,
and a chief part of the money was proportionally distributed
amongst the owners of the two merchantmen
and their cargoes. Those who had been sufferers by
the capture made an acknowledgment through the
<cite>Gazette</cite> of this rare act of restitution, stating their
desire "to give the publicity which it merits to this
trait of generosity and equity, which does honor to
the Society of the Quakers and proves their attachment
to the principles of peace and unity by which
they are distinguished."</p>

<p>"Besides the applications for the restored property,
Dr. Fox received at the same time a reply of a very
different character. It was a letter with this address:
'The Quakers of Congènies-Calvisson to the virtuous
Fox.' The writers describe themselves as a little flock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of about a hundred persons, and express their joy to
hear of the efforts used by the advertiser to fulfil the
commands of Christ. They represent themselves as
opposed to war on Christian principle, and as being in
consequence an object of hatred and contempt to their
fellow-citizens, both Catholics and Protestants. Especially
do they condemn the wars engaged in by
the latter to keep possession of their religious liberties.
This letter led to further correspondence and to a journey
to London by De Marsillac, one of their community.
From his accounts English Friends discovered,
to their surprise, that there had existed in the
south of France for sixty or seventy years a Christian
Church which, besides its testimony against war, held
spiritual views regarding worship and the ministry
identical with their own."</p>

<p>The origin and discovery of these Friends can hardly
fail to interest those who are not already familiar with
them. They were often visited by Stephen Grelet,
who greatly strengthened them and increased their
influence. One who has not been among them can
hardly realize how this little flock, surrounded on all
sides with perils and enemies, rejoice to welcome those
who come to bring them strength and cheer. Many
leave the country to escape the army, some marry with
other Protestants, and the outlook is not encouraging
for their continuance as a distinct body; but they have
a good history behind them, and should receive every
possible support to hold firm for the help of coming
generations.</p>

<p>When Eli and Sybil Jones went among them it was
a time of discouragement, and they both felt that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was a great service for them to do. It is not easy to
find just what they did, but we know that for three
months they carried on almost ceaseless labor to help
and instruct not only the Friends, but all the Protestants
and Catholics where it was possible. The pastors
with one accord opened their places of worship and
approved and welcomed them.</p>

<p>There are many now in Nismes and vicinity who
speak with great feeling of them, and it is evident that
all were deeply impressed by their consecration and
earnestness. We need not seek too eagerly for the
results of such work, for it is impossible to measure
the good done, either in counting those converted or
those renewed. Two earnest Christian ministers exert
an influence and power in a community which can be
no more easily weighed than the ripples on the sea
can be counted.</p>


<p class="center">SOUTH OF FRANCE.</p>

<p>"Set off in the diligence for Lyons, ninety miles distant;
fine roads, good accommodation. The grand
scenery delighted us, though tinged with autumnal
frosts. We did not make ourselves known in Lyons.
It was First day, and it was odd and deeply affecting
to an American guest to rise on this morning and behold
it a market-day, all bustle and tumult. The state
of morals is very low on the Continent.</p>

<p>"<em>31st.</em> Took steamer on the Rhone for Avignon.
Met a very interesting missionary from New York
going to Rome. We had an interesting conversation
on the qualifications of missionaries, their trials, painful
separations, etc. Having both known them, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
could the more readily enter into sympathy and fellowship.
Lodged in a hotel in the dull popish town of
Avignon.</p>

<p>"<em>1st of 11th mo.</em> Set off by rail for Nismes, where we
were greeted by our friends.</p>

<p>"<em>2d.</em> Attended Friends' meeting, and received visits
from several members. We were comfortably settled
at a hotel near the Friends' school, which we wish to
visit when we have leisure from other service.</p>

<p>"<em>3d.</em> Dear Eli went to Congènies to-day to attend
meeting. We have seen dear John Yardly on his
return from his Russian mission. He gave us pleasant
accounts of the work of the Lord in that land and in
Turkey&mdash;said he found much openness and many Christian
brethren. Some have suffered loss of nearly all
things for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ.</p>

<p>"<em>5th.</em> The two-months' meeting commenced. Great
discouragement seems to prevail, and little contending
for the faith once delivered to the saints. It is indeed
to be lamented that the light burns so dimly that was
no doubt kindled by divine love, but for want of watchfulness
it gleams but faintly amid surrounding darkness.
If those who profess the blessed Name in this
land were real converted characters! But, as in ancient
time, 'All are not Israel that are of Israel.' Oh may
it please the Lord to revive His work in this day!
Toward the close life seemed to spring up, and much
solemnity prevailed. Meeting for business assembled
in the afternoon, and was a refreshing season. We
trust some were made to see where they had been straying.
The meeting concluded with more religious
weight and signs of life, and from the hearts of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
arose the song of thanksgiving. Dear John Yardly's
company was indeed precious. I like his evangelical
spirit and devotion to the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>"<em>7th.</em> Attended a meeting at the Methodist house,
which was much favored. Spoke from the first of
John. My dear husband and our kind helpers, R. and
C. Alsop, went to St. Giles for a meeting.</p>

<p>"<em>9th.</em> We took a walk to an old ruin said to be
the temple of Diana. We also went to La Fontaine,
where a large volume of water springs from the
earth. We also saw a beautiful Corinthian temple&mdash;'la
Maison Carrée'&mdash;said to be eighteen hundred
years old.</p>

<p>"<em>11th.</em> Held a meeting for some serious soldiers who
have lately left the Roman Catholic worship. We had
a good meeting with them; one of their number spoke
very well, at the close of our meeting, on the immediate
teaching of the Holy Spirit. This evening went to
Congènies by diligence, accompanied by R. and C.
Alsop, leaving dear Eli to attend meeting at Nismes."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this Eli and Sybil Jones and their kind friends
and helpers attended many meetings at Nismes and at
neighboring towns, going often to Congènies and Fontanés.
Meetings at the latter place seemed especially
opened and favored. Also held meetings, much assisted
and encouraged by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pasteurs</i>, at Calvisson,
Cordonion, Aujargues, Aubais, and Vistric, many of
which, they had evidence, were singularly blessed by
the Master of assemblies. They had many pleasant
meetings with the young people, and were helped to
utter words of cheer and encouragement to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
whose life-work was just beginning. Very frail in body,
and at times almost sinking under the felt duty, yet
they sought to improve every moment of time, not
wishing to make any plans without a direct showing
from their heavenly Leader. All places of Protestant
worship were open to them, and they often used the
large national places of worship called "temples." In
Fontanés they held a greatly blessed meeting in the
parlor of their friend Daniel Brun. They were always
saddened, especially after a meeting at Saint Giles, by
the noticeable scarcity of men in meetings. Indeed,
they found in their meetings generally in France mostly
women and children.</p>

<p>One of the morning meetings in the Friends' house
at Nismes was a most remarkable instance of the overshadowing
of the divine Spirit. The solemnity was
most impressive, so that many wept before a word was
uttered. Sybil Jones was favored to see the time to
rise and testify to the people that a "pure spiritual
worship is what is required, and is the highest joy of
Christians." The visitors attended meeting at the
school supported by Friends in England, and felt it
to be a profitable occasion for all present.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones's mind was often occupied with deep
thoughtfulness of the infinite importance of their mission
to this land, and she besought the Lord earnestly
that their dependence might be on no other, and that
all their labors might be Heaven-directed. It was
very cheering to these tired laborers to have persons
come to them after meetings to acknowledge that they
had been strengthened and to converse on those things
which pertain to godliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>They attended a meeting sustained by young men
in Nismes for general improvement, reading useful
books, etc. They were invited most cordially to come
by the young men, who told them that if they wished
to speak to them on religious subjects, they would be
pleased to hear them. E. and S. Jones felt it a providential
opening, and S. Jones was led to speak from
the text, "The Lord loveth an early sacrifice."</p>

<p>They felt especially moved to thank the Lord for
the "way" so wonderfully made for them. They had
not had to ask for a place to hold a meeting, but when
they felt the impression a place was always offered.
This seemed most wonderful to them, as the laws of
France forbid an assembly exceeding twenty persons at
any place except in a "temple" or consecrated place.
Sometimes they had but "crumbs" to hand out to
the spiritually hungry, but at other times they had
abundant refreshing from the Master's table. They
prayed ever that the "creature might be abased" and
that whether in "heights or depths" they might wear
the entire "armor of faith."</p>

<p>On the last day of the year 1853 they were at the
home of Lydia Majolier at Congènies. Sybil Jones
writes: "This is the close of the second year since I
left the land I so dearly love. The retrospect of the
whole affords consolatory reflection. With the remembrance
of innumerable mercies my poor little sacrifices
sink into insignificance. May they be accepted by
Him who looks at the heart! If any good has been
done, it is the Lord's doings.&mdash;Grant, most merciful
God, that the year 1854 may all be devoted to Thy
service, with more faith and love!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The next two-months' meeting was a season of great
encouragement. The meeting for worship was large,
and the Master honored it with His life-giving presence.
The meeting for business was a blessed season, and all
felt that the power of the Lord had been abroad in the
land; two members were received and two young men
requested to be admitted. At meeting of the school
committee it was concluded "to solicit subscriptions
from Friends here, and see what amount could be
raised, and propose to Friends in England that the
school be continued under the care of Justine Paradon
as superintendent and Clarence Benoit as teacher, and
that a school for boys be opened under the instruction
of Jules Paradon, with an assistant. The committee
were encouraged to persevere in the work, as the school
had already proved a blessing to the youth, and by
some changes for the better might be more so."</p>

<p>A long rainy period hindered these dear Friends
from holding many meetings. They occupied the
time when they were confined to the house in writing
to America, studying French, etc.</p>

<p>At a meeting held in an outlying village at the
house of a woman named Ann Mapit all seemed
tendered before the Lord. Near the close a woman
left and went to her aged father, who had not attended
a religious meeting for fifty years, and begged him to
go and hear these people, "for they preached as though
they would take them all to heaven." The old man
came and was quite moved, and spoke highly of the
meeting, although he had said on a former occasion,
when a meeting was proposed for a Friend, that they
"would beat the drums." They saw plainly the wonder-working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
power of God. On every side they saw
evidences of the "shaking" power.</p>

<p>In Calvisson the pasteur himself, a kind Christian
man, chose to interpret for them, which they thought
a great condescension, as it would doubtless expose
him to ridicule from some who did not approve of a
woman's gift in the ministry. They held a powerful
meeting at Congènies, and found that many were there
who had not attended a religious meeting before for
twenty years. They thought it prudent for a time,
being much worn by long service, to rest and try and
gain some strength to go on. Eli Jones's health was
especially poor. After this short respite they were
much refreshed for the work, and attended a meeting
at Auvergne numbering fully eight hundred or a thousand
people. They appreciated fully the support of
the pasteurs, which was so lovingly tendered them.</p>

<p>They felt everywhere the disastrous effects of the
degraded position of women. Having so much manual
labor to perform, they are unfitted for the proper care
of their children; consequently, both their minds and
bodies are frequently uncared for, and the home, that
great training-school, is not rendered as bright and
attractive as it should be. This, S. Jones thought, is
what makes the French people so volatile and often
skeptical. The places of public amusement are often
sought in preference to the home.</p>

<p>Their work among the soldiers was a wonderful
thing. Many came to their meetings, and, laying
aside their swords and taking off their caps, sat meekly
down to hear the glad tidings of "peace on earth and
good-will toward men." A remarkable movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sprang up among them. One of their number said
that at one time but three of them met for worship,
but lately nine had joined their number, and they
felt much encouraged. Many meetings were attended
by these soldiers, who seemed to appeal directly to
Eli and Sybil Jones's sympathies.</p>

<p>They held a meeting at St. Hippolyte with the
few Friends there, at the Moravian meeting-house,
and were very urgently pressed to hold more meetings
in that place. Fears were often felt by their friends
that order could not be maintained in their meetings,
owing to the novelty of the thing; but they always,
even in very large audiences, met with the utmost
respect and attention. They went on one occasion to
Marseilles, and took a short trip on the Mediterranean,
and felt that they gained some strength by the change.
Sybil Jones, accompanied by some of her friends and
the good pasteur Abausit, who had been such a kind
friend and interpreter, went to Montpellier to visit the
prison. They were much pleased with the neatness
and order of the entire establishment, and met the
most courteous treatment from the chaplain and director.
There was much tenderness shown by the prisoners.
There were in the prison eight hundred Catholic
and fourteen Protestant prisoners. They were not
allowed to speak to the former, but were enabled to
pray earnestly for the other poor souls. They held
a very large meeting in the afternoon, and it was to
them a precious season. Sybil Jones visited two
prisoners in their cells, and pleaded tenderly with
them.</p>

<p>They then returned to Nismes and held a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
meeting. One of the pasteurs told them, in explanation
of their kind reception on every hand, that the
Society of Friends moved along so prudently, peaceably,
and happily that they were received by all as
Christian brethren. At a meeting in St. Hippolyte
great contrition was felt by a man who had not attended
meeting for many years, and would not permit his wife
to go, and forbade his sister to enter his house because
she was religious. He received his sister after the
meeting, and seemed greatly humbled. They felt that
the Lord was speaking through his instruments, and
were encouraged to go forward. They held many
large and much-blessed meetings at Gallargues and
Congènies, and visited many to whom they were
attracted, as they showed a concern for their souls'
welfare. Many came to inquire of them the "way,"
and they formed many acquaintances and felt a binding
interest in the people, whose souls were so precious.</p>

<p>When the two-months' meeting again assembled
they had renewed cause for encouragement. It was
a meeting graciously ordered by the Lord. The
meeting for worship on First-day morning was remarkably
covered with divine power and goodness,
and Eli Jones seemed unusually "clothed upon with
gospel unction." The meeting for business admitted
into membership a man who had been a Methodist
minister, and received requests from twelve others.
They were once invited to the home of a good pasteur
named Mensard, where they met five other pasteurs,
and their conversation was most pleasant concerning
the ministry and "things of the kingdom."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>And now they felt that the burden of souls in the
south of France was rolled off, and they were sweetly
released for service in other fields. They held a large
parting meeting, and many came to take leave, among
them a poor soldier in whom they were greatly interested.
He had been ordered to Constantinople without
the companionship of any of his religious friends. Of
this they were not aware, and it was remarkable that
they felt impressed to read the ninety-first Psalm,
which seemed so suited to his case, and Sybil Jones
was wonderfully helped to pray for the poor soldier.
The parting with the school-children was an affecting
season, and they at last set off, leaving a large group
of friends at the hotel-door for whom their hearts
reached out in tenderness and love.</p>

<p>They went to Avignon, and from there by boat on
the Rhone to Lyons. On First day they attended
three meetings in that city; where they found an
earnest, seeking people. They lodged with a dear
friend who was received into membership at the last
meeting. He seemed to be exerting a religious influence
about him. They enjoyed their intercourse with
his interesting family, and M. J. Lecky offered to take
their youngest son, Benjamin, to England to obtain a
knowledge of the English language; which pleased
his parents and he was committed to her care. They
spent one day in the great capital, and admired the
magnificent and stupendous works of art with which
Paris is adorned. Sailed from Havre for Southampton.
There they attended one meeting, and thence
proceeded to London. They attended Suffolk quarterly
meeting. The power of the Lord was felt, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
by the young. Lodged at Richard Dikes
Alexander's.</p>

<p>In London they lodged at Thomas Norton's, and attended
London quarterly meeting. Attended Brighton
select meeting, and stayed at Daniel Prior Hack's.
They also attended meetings at Croydon and Lewes,
and Gloucester quarterly meeting; all of which were
honored by the Master's presence. On the 11th of
4th mo. they set off for Plymouth, and soon after sailed
for the dear home in America, leaving all their work
with the Master, for it was all done in His name.
They carried with them sweet memories of the aid and
fellowship extended to them by the French pasteurs.
They also carried with them numerous written testimonials
of the pasteurs' appreciation of their labor of
love among them. The following is a letter from the
pasteurs and elders of Calvisson expressive of their
feeling toward these laborers in the Master's vineyard
who had come from a distant land:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We, the pasteurs and elders of the church of Calvisson
(Gard), declare that we have received the visit
of Eli and Sybil Jones, ministers of the Society of
Friends. They have held two edifying public meetings
in our temple, before a numerous and attentive
audience, as well as a special meeting for the children
of our schools. Moreover, they have held a pastoral
conference at Calvisson (Gard), at which eleven pasteurs
of our consistory and the neighboring churches were
present. We are happy to thank these dear friends
for the evangelical words they have brought to us.
Their presence has been for us a means of edification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and of encouragement. Their prayers and their exhortations,
impressed with great spirituality, have produced
deep convictions and been visibly blessed, and
have penetrated into the hearts of all those who have
had the privilege of hearing them. The interest they
have manifested for the salvation of souls and the
advancement of the kingdom of God has touched
us in a lively manner, and has given us the impression
that they do not propose any other end nor any other
recompense for their sacrifices and their labors. They
have spoken amongst us the words of peace and charity,
nor has anything in their discourses wounded any
faithful soul, either as regards his faith or his individual
opinions. We ask that in an especial manner
the divine blessing may attend the spiritual ministry
of Mr. and Mrs. Jones. We desire that the dear
brother and sister may be instrumental in shedding
around them, wherever the Lord may call them, that
humble confidence in the wisdom from above that
characterizes all their discourses and their lives. May
the Father of spirits, who holds our hearts in His hand,
grant to their prayers and their efforts the awakening
of souls and of consciences! Our Church will always
preserve a precious remembrance of these dear friends,
and sends them, through us, the expression of its
prayers and its gratitude. We declare that we know
individually that Eli and Sybil Jones have also visited
the greater part of the numerous churches which surround
us, and that everywhere their preaching has
been heard with the same interest and the same edification.
All our brethren have been, like ourselves,
moved and charmed by the unction and the grace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
their Christian exhortations. In the belief thereof we
have given to them the present certificate.</p>

<h3><em>IN THE MAINE LEGISLATURE.</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Christ came into the World peace was sung; and when He
went out of the world peace was bequeathed."</p></blockquote>


<p>The first decided action of the Maine Legislature in
regard to the sale of intoxicating liquors was taken in
the autumn of 1846. Much work had been done during
the two preceding years in the towns to arouse
the people to the necessity of bringing about an entire
revolution, and the temperance organizations worked
zealously to base all the structure they built on total
abstinence. The foundation truth was laid by Jesus
Christ in Judea in words that meant, "If any one of
thy passions or appetites causes thee to do wrong, cut
it off and cast it from thee." The <em>necessity</em> for total
abstinence was vigorously enforced by Eli Jones whenever
he spoke. Enough believers in temperance were
sent to the Legislature in 1846 to pass a law "to restrict
the sale of intoxicating drinks." This was followed
in 1851 by an "Act for the suppression of
drinking-houses and tippling-shops." This was the
well-known "Maine Law," and forbade the manufacture
for sale of intoxicating liquors, except cider.
Unadulterated cider in quantities of five gallons and
upward might be sold. There were thirty-nine other
sections directed against liquor-selling, drunkenness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and the habit of drinking in the community. This
law accomplished a very beneficial work. One of its
great results was to bring the temperance question
more emphatically before the other States and nations.
At home it made drinking disgraceful and took away
to a great extent the temptation from the young men.
While in small towns it was nearly a perfect success in
closing all shops, in the cities there was not vigilance
enough to carry out its purpose, and many felt that
more vigor must be used.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1854, the town of China elected
Eli Jones by a large majority over two other candidates
to represent it in the "House" of the Legislature. It
was expected that he would carry to the State capital
the views which he unceasingly expressed at home,
and that he would agitate a still further reform, or, as
he expressed it, "put new teeth into the old law." The
choice was wholly unexpected to him, and he was
working for the election of his lifelong friend, Ambrose
Abbot. He was given a prominent place on the committees,
and especially the Committee on Temperance.
He worked almost continuously to bring about the desired
legislation, but seldom spoke, most of his work
being in the committee.</p>

<p>This was a memorable winter at Augusta, and many
excellent men were there in the different branches of
the State government. It was a great opportunity for
a true Friend to show to legislators the worth of his
principles. Eli Jones was the only man who refused
to rise when the governor called upon the united
House and Senate to take the oath of office, and
he stood alone to give <em>affirmation</em> that he would faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
perform his work. As was said before, Eli Jones,
though earnestly at work for the good of the people
of the State, did not address the House. Some members,
who knew him intimately and wished to call him
to his feet, arranged a plan, not as a personal jest, but
as a scheme to gain a speech. In the course of the
session the appointment of a major-general to the
second division of the Maine militia came in order.</p>

<p>In 1838, Maine had undertaken to assert by force
of arms her title to a region near the northern boundary
claimed both by her and by Canada. There was
much mustering of troops at the capital, and fully ten
thousand soldiers marched through the deep snow and
fierce cold to drive the enemy from Aroostook county.
Though they were brave and ready for battle, happily
no blood was shed and peace was wisely made; but
the "Aroostook War" became famous as a subject
of banter and many jokes were made at the expense
of its officers. The old nursery rhyme was quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"The king of France, with forty thousand men,</div>
<div class="line">Marched up the hill and then&mdash;marched down again."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Primarily for these two reasons, to urge Eli Jones to
his feet and to joke the former officers by appointing
a Quaker, an avowed peace-advocate, he was chosen
unanimously to fill the vacancy in the office of major-general.</p>

<p>The nomination was so wholly unexpected that he
was at first perplexed at his situation. Much was at
stake and wisdom and caution were needed. Having
his horse at Augusta, he drove that night to his home
at Dirigo, fifteen miles away, chiefly perhaps to discuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
his course with his family and the Friends most suitable
for counsel. After talking into the night with his
brother-in-law, James van Blarcom, he walked the floor
alone until the new day was dawning. On arriving
again at Augusta he found the occasion far more
important than he had anticipated. The news had
spread that the Quaker was to speak in regard to his
appointment; and the Representatives' Hall was crowded,
not only most of the Senate being present, but numbers
from the city. The subject of the business was
introduced, and Eli Jones, rising, spoke in substance
as follows:</p>

<p>"Whatever my ambition may have been in times
past, my aspirations have never embraced such an
office as this as an object of desire. I can assure
the House that my election as major-general was an
honor wholly unexpected. It is true that when the
governor announced to this House the existence of
the vacancy, a member privately remarked to me, 'I
shall vote for you,' but I replied to him, declining the
honor and proposed to return the compliment.</p>

<p>"To my mind there is something ominous in this
occurrence. I regard it as one of the wonderful developments
of the times. Who of us that assembled
ten years ago in quiet and retired places to affix our
signatures to pledges of abstinence from intoxicating
drinks would have believed that in 1855 we should be
elected to the seats we now occupy amidst the overwhelming
rejoicing of the people, pledged to the support
of the Maine Law? Who that at that time had
visited the plantations of the South, and seen the slave
toiling under the lash of the taskmaster, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
believed that in 1855 the people of the larger portion
of this great land would have roused up with a stern
determination to subdue the encroachments of the
slave-power, and pledge themselves never to cease
their labors until the wrongs of slavery should be
ameliorated&mdash;nay more, till slavery itself should be
abolished? Still more wonderful, who would have
believed that the State of Maine, that a few years
since gloried in an Aroostook expedition, and was
noisy with military training and the din of arms,
would in 1855 exhibit the spectacle of a peaceable
member of the Society of Friends being elected to
the post of major-general of a division of the militia,
and that too by the Representatives of the people in
their legislative capacity?</p>

<p>"But I have endeavored to regulate my own conduct
by the principle that legislation should not go
very far in advance of public sentiment, and it seems
to me that this election may possibly be ahead of that
sentiment. I submit this suggestion in all candor. It
is generally understood that I entertain peculiar views
in respect to the policy of war. If, however, I am an
exponent of the views of the Legislature on this subject,
I will cheerfully undertake to serve the State in
the capacity indicated. With much pleasure I should
stand before the militia of the second division and
give such orders as I think best. The first would be,
'Ground Arms!' The second would be, 'Right about
face! beat your swords into ploughshares and your
spears into pruning-hooks, and learn war no more!'
And I should then dismiss every man to his farm and
his merchandise, with an admonition to read daily at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his fireside the New Testament and ponder upon its
tidings of 'Peace on earth and good-will to men.'</p>

<p>"If, on the other hand, it should be determined that
my election is a little in advance of the times, I am
willing, as a good citizen, to bow to the majesty of
law, and, as a member of the Legislature, to consult
its dignity and decline the exalted position tendered
me by the House; and I will now decline it. With
pleasure I will surrender to the House this trust and
the honor and retire to private life."</p>

<p>This speech was delivered amid interruptions of
loud applause, and made a great sensation throughout
the State. And not in Maine only; it was commented on
in many of the newspapers and appeared in the columns
of English journals. Pictures of the fighting Quaker
were made, with the order to his troops printed below.
It even came out in an African journal; so that what
seemed like an unimportant pleasantry on the part of
the members of the Legislature gave Eli Jones an
opportunity to preach peace to a very extended audience,
and his voice was heard far beyond the little
State capital. From this time he was regarded with
much respect by all the members, and he received
encouragement and support in whatever he desired
to accomplish.</p>

<p>At the close of the session he called to thank the
governor for his kindness to him and his help in different
ways, and he remarked to the latter that he had
been in rather a peculiar place during the winter and
had felt somewhat like a "speckled bird." The governor
said, "Mr. Jones, what you call being a 'speckled
bird' has given you more influence than anything else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
could possibly have done." Whatever he may have
accomplished in other lines during his term of office,
he gave powerful testimony in favor of peace and temperance
and against the use of oaths, and he went back
to his quiet farm in China thoroughly respected by all
with whom he had been associated.</p>


<p class="center">OAK GROVE SEMINARY.</p>

<p>It may be a fitting place to speak of his connection
with Oak Grove Seminary, as he was at work for its
interests not long after this time. As I have in my
possession a letter written by him in regard to the
beginning and early days of the school, I will insert
it here:</p>

<p>"Oak Grove Seminary was started about the year
1850 by John D. Lang, Samuel Taylor, Ebenezer Frye,
Alden Sampson, and Alton Pope. They had in view
the guarded and religious education of the children
of Friends. It was to be a '<em>select</em>' school. William
H. Hobbie was the first principal. I visited his school
and thought him a wonderful teacher. He stood before
his class without a book, and seemed to be himself
the book. Up to that time I had never seen the like.
Franklin Paige, the present publisher of the <cite>Friends'
Review</cite>, followed William Hobbie in the principalship.
Financially, the undertaking after a while proved a
failure, and the school was closed.</p>

<p>"At a meeting of the yearly meeting's committee on
education, held in China in the autumn of 1856, I advocated
an effort being made to open Oak Grove Seminary
again. It was opposed by some on the ground
that we needed primary schools more than high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
schools: to that idea my answer was, We must first
have high schools to prepare teachers for the primary
schools. A meeting of the original proprietors of the
seminary was called, and the question put to them,
'Are you willing to have other Friends join you in
opening the seminary?' Samuel Taylor replied, 'We
want to know first what you will do; we do not want
to depend upon a rope of sand.'&mdash;'What are the conditions
on which we can join you?'&mdash;'Do as much as
we have; give $2500.' To this Alden Sampson replied,
'It is useless to think of opening the school
with $2500; we must have $15,000. If you will
raise that amount I will give $1000.' Ebenezer Frye
responded as liberally. A committee was appointed
to raise the fifteen thousand dollars. Eli Jones, William
A. Sampson, Joseph Estes, and Thomas B. Nichols
were the chief workers in raising the proposed sum.
They were successful. It was nearly all subscribed
by six hundred Maine Friends. They constituted an
association for the opening and management of Oak
Grove Seminary.</p>

<p>"In the summer and autumn of 1857 the boarding-house
was built. James van Blarcom was chosen principal,
and Sarah B. Taber of Albion teacher. It was
found that James van Blarcom's engagements would
not allow of his occupying the place for one year,
consequently Eli Jones took this position for the first
year. The school opened in the 12th month, 1857.
The season had been wet, and the building and preparation
for the school proceeded slowly. Much hard
work devolved upon the principal and teachers. The
pupils were numerous, and the spring term brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
140. A case of scarlet fever, resulting in the death
of a lovely girl, rapidly reduced the number, which
has not been reached since.</p>

<p>"At the opening of the second year Albert Smiley
became principal and James van Blarcom governor
and boarding-master.</p>

<p>"Albert Smiley was followed by Augustine Jones,
and he by Richard M. Jones.</p>

<p>"Oak Grove has furnished principals for Friends'
School at Providence for nearly a quarter of a century,
and to the Penn Charter School of Philadelphia for
about thirteen years. Ten or twelve of its pupils have
been or are ministers in the Society of Friends; some
are to-day leading business-men.</p>

<p>"The writer of this notice has been connected with
the management of the institution for the last thirty
years, sometimes influentially, sometimes wellnigh
powerless. As the record has been made, so it will
stand. I have rejoiced in the times of its prosperity;
I have wept over the ashes of its fine buildings, its
library, its geological museum. I now see the second
temple rising from the ashes of the first with an unlooked-for
splendor. May it long stand for the benefit
of our race and the glory of God!"</p>

<p>Sybil Jones was at work in the Southern States
during a part of the year 1860, and returned to her
Northern home only a few weeks before the attack on
Fort Sumter. The sound of war carried sorrow to the
hearts of herself and her husband. They were loyal
to their country and the great cause of human freedom,
but they were loyal also to the Prince of peace.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"They prayed for love to lose the chain;</div>
<div class="line">'Twas shorn by battle's axe in twain!"</div>
</div></div>

<p>For years they had longed to see the light of freedom
break in on the South, but they had hoped no
less for the day "when the war-drum should throb no
longer" and universal peace should gladden the long
watchers for its dawn. Now they saw the oncoming
of a most terrible civil war, threatening the life of the
nation. They mourned for mothers and fathers who
must see their boys go to the field; they thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the homes shattered for ever; but they did not yet
realize that their eldest son was to go forth to return
only on his shield&mdash;that the son who had urged them
to go forward in the work of love in Liberia, their
noble son, was to be demanded as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>The war was hardly begun when James Parnel Jones
resolved to volunteer. President Lincoln's call seemed
a call to him. He had been a logical reader of Sumner,
and had closely watched the development of slavery,
and to his mind the war to save our nationality would
necessarily free the slaves. He wrote from the South:
"Did I not think this war would loose the slave's
chains I would break my sword and go home."</p>

<p>That it was hard for him to go when his parents
were praying for peace there can be no doubt, but his
mind was filled with the thought of saving the life of
a nation, and he certainly felt that the path of duty was
in that direction.</p>

<p>The members of the Society of Friends felt almost
universally that they owed allegiance to two fatherlands.
"There was a patriotism of the soul whose
claim absolved them from the other and terrene fealty,"
and there was a manifest inconsistency between being
members of "Christ's invisible kingdom" and taking
arms in support of a dominion measured by acres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Some felt otherwise, and they took upon themselves
the hard duty of turning from society and friends to
do battle.</p>

<p>James Parnel came home wounded, but returned to
his command before his furlough had expired. He
went back with the feeling that the days left him were
few: he indistinctly saw what awaited him. In an engagement
to carry a strong point held by the enemy
at Crystal Springs, near Washington, he was struck by
a ball from a sharpshooter. The ball had glanced
from a tree and brought him a mortal wound. The
two hearts deeply wrung to have their son go into the
war at all were pierced at the news of his death. We
can hardly conceive their grief for him for whom they
had so earnestly prayed and agonized in his absence.
Henceforth whoever wore a soldier's uniform had a
place in Sybil Jones's heart. Her unspent love went
out to all who were suffering on the field and in the
hospitals, and she could not rest at home. Obtaining
the needful credentials, she took up in a new form the
arduous service of her active and consecrated life,
bearing the gospel cheer to the wounded and dying
in Philadelphia and Washington. She could tell the
soldiers of her own son, and so touch their hearts, and
her sympathy and love brought joy to many a poor
sufferer. The aggregate of her visits shows that she
preached and talked to thirty thousand soldiers. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and from the field of her labor, at the dépôts, wherever
she saw a uniform, she went to speak gentle words and
to bear good news; and only those to whom the balm
came can tell the good accomplished. Once more she
met a kind reception from all. Soldiers and prisoners
welcomed her, and those high in power listened with
respect to her messages. She comforted the widow
of President Lincoln, and twice stood before his successor,
President Johnson, and faithfully warned him
to rely on the Ruler of the universe for counsel in guiding
the helm of state.</p>

<p>She left home in 1st mo., 1865, with a certificate for
service. On her way to the field in which she felt
called to labor she visited her children in Philadelphia,
and attended meeting at Germantown, where she was
favored with a gospel message. She also attended
Twelfth street meeting and the large quarterly meeting
in Arch street, where she was constrained to speak
for her Master. She then proceeded to Baltimore,
accompanied by Lydia Hawkes of Manchester, Maine.
In this city she met her dear husband, who had
been separated from her for three months. He was
much worn by his labors as distributing agent of
the New England Friends. He had distributed to
the necessities of the freedmen food, clothing, beds,
etc., according to the quantity sent to the mission.
He had visited them from hut to hut, administering
as well to their spiritual as to their temporal needs.
They together attended Baltimore quarterly meeting,
and on the 9th of 2d mo. arrived in Washington.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones rested a few days, and then commenced
the labors for which she was liberated. Her first service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was in Judiciary Square. She, with her companion,
was taken there in an ambulance, and they
were preceded and introduced by their dear friend
Jane James, who often gave them like aid. They
were pleasantly received, and permission was granted
them to perform any religious service. They visited
nine wards and had service in the chapel, speaking
words of comfort to those confined to their beds.
Much seriousness and tenderness was apparent. They
also went to the hospital at Armory Square, visited all
the wards of the sick and wounded, and had chapel
service. It seemed that some were turning to the
Lord.</p>

<p>Eli Jones went for a short time to Philadelphia to
try and gain a little strength, being very weary with
his labors among the colored people. The mud was
very deep and the work of distributing very hard.
Their son, Richard Mott, accompanied his father,
having spent the vacation from his studies at Haverford
College with his parents at their post of duty.</p>

<p>Camp Hospital was also visited. They were taken
out in an ambulance by Dr. Upton, who was courteous
in every way. The poor wounded ones seemed
thankful for the interest exhibited for their souls' welfare.
Carm Hospital was visited, and all freedom was
given them to point the sick and suffering to the Lamb
of God. Many were in tears at the close of service
in the chapel. Her own torn mother's heart gave
Sybil Jones great earnestness in prayer for the bereaved
ones in the far-away homes as she was called
upon to attend the funerals of the soldiers. Often
more than one coffin stood on a form before them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and the occasion was made a solemn admonition to
the survivors to be ready when the Lord should call.
One of the meetings was attended by a surgeon who
had led a profane and dissolute life. He was reached
by the Spirit of God, and in a meeting rose and said,
"I have been living for hell; I looked toward it as my
home, and fully expected it; but God has had mercy
on my soul and pardoned my sins, and I mean to serve
Him the rest of my days." Nearly all were in tears.
When the service was over the soldiers rushed to his
arms weeping with joy. He said to them: "I have
treated you badly and sworn at you, but by the grace
of God I will never swear again." His conversion had
a wonderful effect and was a powerful testimony for
the truth.</p>

<p>Columbia Hospital was visited. They found a very
conscientious, loving superintendent in one of the
wards, a lady named O. L. Pomeroy. In this ward
they held a most blessed meeting and made an appointment
for another.</p>

<p>They were obliged to move from their lodgings on
account of sickness in the family, and were most
kindly received by their good friends William and
Jane James. They found it a great privilege to be
so cared for.</p>

<p>They went to Lincoln Hospital, where were five
thousand men. Their ministrations were much blessed:
at a later visit they found four hundred more wounded
soldiers from City Point. The afflicted men were all
broken down with suffering and were ready for the
consolation of the gospel. The field indeed seemed
white unto the harvest. A lad told them that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
been in the Crimean War, and had served two years
in this. He was an Englishman. He showed them
a silver medal gained by valor in the former war.
Sybil Jones said, "I hope thou art seeking a crown
in that higher warfare?" He quickly replied, "I am
pressing after it with all my might; I am looking to
Jesus as my Captain."</p>

<p>She sighed for "universal peace to reign" as she
witnessed the untold miseries of cruel war. It was
wonderfully touching to hear the bright testimonies
of those poor feeble ones who had lain for months on
their emaciated backs. Many were passing away. No
one could bear to tell one poor dying youth that he
could not live, and in all tenderness Sybil Jones said
to him, "I think thou cannot get well; what is thy
hope?" He replied, "In Jesus I believe; he has forgiven
my sins. Tell my father and mother I have
gone to heaven." Some seemed insensible of their
danger, but were faithfully warned to prepare to meet
their God. As these faithful messengers of good
tidings saw the terribly mangled brought in, and
beheld their patience and tenderness, they were sick
at heart and prayed for the terrible tide of war to be
stopped. They met with much kindness from Surgeon-general
Barnes, who gave Sybil Jones a pass to
all the hospitals in the United States, and a special
one for the department of the South, with half-fare
on Government transports.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones was presented to General Auger, the
military commander of the District of Columbia. He
said that he was much pleased with her mission. He
was spoken to concerning the interests of eternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
She was presented to Secretary Stanton and Colonel
Harder, and was pleased with their demeanor and
readiness to aid her work in every possible way. The
Centre Guardhouse was visited and its four hundred
inmates lovingly warned to be ready.</p>

<p>On 4th mo. 1st, 1865, great excitement was felt in
the capital city, as the President was personally
directing affairs at Richmond, and the fall of the
rebellious city was hourly anticipated. On the morning
of the 3d came the joyful intelligence that the
Confederate capital had been evacuated, and a great
tide of rejoicing swept over the loyal States. Sybil
Jones describes the scene in Washington as follows:</p>

<p>"I was very fearful the inhabitants would be too
full of joy to remember their great Deliverer and give
thanks unto His name. We went to Camp Fry, and
had to press our way through the throng, often pausing
to note the variety of emotions exhibited&mdash;all joyful,
but neither ridiculous nor profane. A subdued
awe seemed to hold in check the lawless and dissipated,
and tears of joy suffused the eyes of passers-by. The
whistles of the engines, the roar of cannon, the music
of the various bands, and the shouts of the multitude,
mingled with the prayers, praises, and hallelujahs of
the colored people, some down on their knees in the
dust of the street, others dancing like David before
the ark of the covenant on its return to its place,&mdash;all
commingled in one mighty jubilant song which
I trust was not devoid of the grateful tribute of
praise to the great God of heaven and earth. We
at length entered the ward of the sick and wounded
of two regiments, about two thousand men. As we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
passed in I said, 'To-day is the nation's jubilee, and
we have come to present our thank-offering with you,
as you cannot join the street celebration.' A smile
and 'Thank you' went round and brightened up the
scene. We read a beautiful psalm and bore a testimony
to the power and goodness of God, not only
in hope of the full and entire emancipation of the
slaves, but in disclosing to us to-day, behind the folds
of the dark war-cloud, the silver lining of peace. We
besought them to come to the Lamb of God, seeing
his mercy and loving-kindness had been so great to
them as to spare them amid the din of battle when
their comrades had fallen all around them."</p>

<p>Sybil Jones and her friends visited Seminary Hospital,
and found among the wounded a young Friend
from Illinois, who was much comforted by hearing the
gospel tidings from a member of the Society he loved
so well. A sad scene presented itself in Douglas Hospital.
There had just arrived three hundred terribly
mangled soldiers, some passing away, some in agony
with lost limbs. It was an indescribably painful scene,
and the one "Physician of value" was recommended
to the poor sufferers.</p>

<p>They addressed many prisoners of war, deserters
from the South, and refugees. They were listened to
with seriousness, and many were in tears. On a visit
to Stanton Hospital, Sybil Jones met a young man
from Maine named Eben Dinsmore. He told her
that her son, James Parnel Jones, had been his captain
when he first enlisted, and afterward his major. He
spoke in the highest terms of his kindness to the men
and his unspotted name, and said he heard a soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the same regiment say that he was with him from
the time he was wounded until his death, and never
saw a person die so happy, singing as he passed
away.</p>

<p>At this time Sybil Jones and friends moved their
lodgings, at the kind invitation of their friend Isaac
Newton, to make their home with him for a while.</p>

<p>On the 15th of 4th mo. came the dreadful news that
the good man who had stood so nobly at the head
of the nation in this dreadful crisis had gone from
works to reward, slain by the hand of the assassin.
The great joy was turned into deepest mourning that
he who was so endeared to all loyal hearts could not
be with them to enjoy the restful time of peace. They
held a meeting in the rooms of the Agricultural Department,
and were comforted in their great grief by
the presence of Him who said to the troubled waves,
"Peace, be still." A visit was made to Stone Hospital,
and it was found that the suffering ones there
had had little religious instruction, but seemed grateful
for Christian counsel. One poor fellow, who was
dying and felt his lost condition, was entreated to look
to the "Lamb of God."</p>

<p>A young lady came one day to Isaac Newton's and
asked if a Quaker lady who preached was there. She
said that some one had been thinking how appropriate
it would be to have a Friends' meeting, for the awful
stroke inclined them to be silent. Isaac Newton offered
his parlors, and Sybil Jones consented. She says in
her diary: "We met at seven o'clock, and it was
one of the most blessed seasons I have enjoyed in
this city. The silence seemed to have healing in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
wings and balm to the stricken spirit." Much service
was done in Emory Hospital; the poor fellows on their
beds were visited one by one, and each was lovingly
spoken to. They held meetings at Emory Hospital
for the convalescent soldiers, and by all they were
most gladly received. Harwood and Finley Hospitals
were fields of labor, and in each the gospel message
was thankfully received. At first the surgeon in
charge said that he never allowed service in the wards
where the men were badly wounded or passing away.
Sybil Jones said to him, "Doctor, wouldst thou take
the responsibility of keeping the gospel from dying
men, the suffering soldiers of our country, far from
their homes and mothers?"&mdash;"No," said he, "but I
do not want them disturbed."&mdash;She said, "Our services
never disturb; we are a quiet people." She
then told him that she had a pass to all hospitals in
the United States, but would not insist upon entering
without his full permission. He then gave it
most freely. The service was gladly received, and it
seemed like drops of rain on a dry and thirsty land.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones felt that she must bear a message of her
heavenly Father's love and sympathy to the widow of
the lamented President. She had been ill, confined to
her bed in the White House, since the fatal stroke.
Sybil Jones says of the visit: "All crushed and broken
under the heavy stroke, I spoke to her of the heavenly
Chastener's love and care, and said that He could bind
up the broken heart and give peace. She cordially
invited us to come again. Her two sons, one about
ten and the other about twenty, were at home, and
very affectionate and attentive to their suffering mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
though themselves evidently feeling very deeply the sad
event."</p>

<p>Sybil Jones felt that she was given a message for
Secretary Stanton. She in company with others went
to his house in the evening, and, passing a guard of
soldiers, was most kindly received by his interesting
wife, the Secretary being absent. They spent an hour in
pleasant conversation, and then the Secretary came and
greeted them kindly. Very soon silence reigned, and
Sybil Jones, after asking permission, rose and addressed
the Secretary, telling him that as he had been raised
up by the Almighty for the important duties of his
office, he must dispense justice and judgment in the
fear of God, plead the cause of the oppressed, and
humbly in all things do the will of the great King,
and the eternal God should be his refuge. She told
him that, though his life had been sought, the angel
of the Lord had guarded him, and if his trust was in
Him no harm should befall him. After her remarks
the Secretary rose and thanked her most profoundly,
and told her that her gospel message was most grateful,
and said that he needed the prayers of the people
and that his trust was in God.</p>

<p>Sybil Jones went again by invitation to call on the
President's widow. She was still in bed, much prostrated.
The rooms were all lighted as in the days
when their master paced through them with the weight
of his mission pressing upon him. One lone sentinel
guarded the mansion&mdash;a strange contrast to the past,
when a strong guard was deemed necessary. The
desolate lady gave them a sweet welcome, and told
them some cheering incidents of her husband's last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
days. She said that several times during the last day
he lived he said, "This is the happiest day of my life."
He seemed to feel that the great work was done, and
he rejoiced that the cloud which hung over his beloved
America had lifted. Sybil Jones then spoke to her
cheeringly of the sympathy of Jesus with the sorrowing
sisters of Bethany&mdash;that in her boys she had a
charge to keep for the King. After a season of feeling
prayer they parted tenderly.</p>

<p>Stone Hospital, a beautiful home for the weary, suffering
soldiers, was visited, and a wonderfully convicting
season it proved. Sybil Jones was greatly saddened
on a visit to the jail by its filthy appearance. Old and
young were crowded in together, and the young in
crime were by association with the vicious and degraded
hastened in their downward course.</p>

<p>Feeling that she was called to labor in Alexandria,
Sybil Jones went across the river to that place, and
found a kind welcome at the temporary home of James
P. Barlow, he, with his family, having fled from his
own home on account of rebel persecution and confiscation.
She had a meeting with the convalescents
in the colored hospital, and had most interesting services
in Slough Barracks. She also had a large meeting
at the Soldiers' Rest, where she addressed thousands
of soldiers, all orderly and attentive, while a tear
might often be seen tracing down the bronzed cheeks.
Wonderful changes were apparent in this place since
the abolition of slavery. Slave-pens were appropriated
to useful purposes. One was used as a court of justice,
where traitors took the oath of allegiance to their
country and to the government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Sybil Jones then returned to Washington, and did
what she could in the hospitals there, and then, feeling
again the call to Alexandria, she returned to that place,
and after more service owned and blessed by the Master
she left this great field of labor and went once more
to her children in Philadelphia, and thence to her own
home.</p>

<p>On the 16th of 4th mo., in 1866, she again left her
home, accompanied as far as Providence by her son
Grelet, and bearing a certificate from her friends granting
freedom for such service as she was called to perform.
She attended meetings at Salem, Lynn, and
Burlington, visiting prisons, hospitals, and reformatory
institutions. She went to Richmond, Va., and attended
the small meeting of Friends there, and with them
praised the Lord for bringing them through the bloody
rebellion and allowing them once more to assemble
under the banner of peace. She attended many meetings
here; had a meeting in a penitentiary, where the
poor inmates had not heard the gospel sound for five
years, since before the dreadful struggle. Many Bibles
were distributed and families visited.</p>

<p>In a town near Richmond it was thought very doubtful
if she could obtain a meeting, as the feeling against
the North was so strong. When the Methodist minister
was applied to, a young man present exclaimed,
"That Quaker lady must have a meeting; she is the
mother of my college classmate, Major Jones. She
must have a meeting, and we will do our best to get
the people out." The meeting was a large one and
blessed, and the people expressed their thanks at the
close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>After much loving service in the prisons and elsewhere,
Sybil Jones went once more to Washington,
holding meetings and doing all she could to "lift the
skirts of darkness." She felt that she had another
message to bear to the White House, where now, at
the head of affairs of state, was the late President's
successor, Andrew Johnson. She had a most touching
interview with the President's daughter, the wife
of Senator Patterson. They mingled their prayers
and tears, and then Sybil Jones was presented to
the President. He was surrounded by supplicants,
mothers, advocates of right, and artful politicians.
While waiting for audience the President's little granddaughter
offered to her a beautiful bouquet of flowers,
and, drawing her close, Sybil Jones spoke to her of
the infinitely more beautiful flowers of heaven. The
President courteously gave her permission to speak.
She told him her message, and told him that it was in
the name of the "King of kings." He thanked her
seriously, and many were in tears. It was a most
impressive scene.</p>

<p>After this, Sybil Jones returned to Maine, but she
was not permitted long to enjoy the sweet associations
in the home so dear to her. The impression
seemed to gather force daily that she must once
more cross the ocean. These words came to her
often with great emphasis: "Get thee out of thy own
country and from among thy own kindred to a land
which I shall show thee." Once more she cast her
burden upon the meeting, and found, as ever, the sweet
sympathy and unity with her call to go forth that were
ever accorded her. She was liberated for the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
that she felt was hers to perform, and her "peace
flowed like a river."</p>

<p>Before engaging in the work in Europe, Sybil Jones
obtained a certificate from the monthly meeting to
visit the prisons and penitentiaries in some of the
Southern States. She visited most institutions of
that character in many of the large Southern cities,
bearing the news of life and salvation to the poor
erring ones. Many tracts and Bibles were distributed
and much work was done in the vineyard of the Lord.
Once more she bore a message to President Johnson.
She went to the White House on a reception day for
the President's daughter, and passed in with the throng.
On every side were seen the glory and parade of this
world that will pass away, but, obtaining audience with
the President and his daughter, she spoke to them of
the pleasures that are eternal. The Lord helped her
to declare the truth, and she went away trusting that
it would not be "in vain in the Lord." Her whole
soul was rejoiced to see the great change that had
swept over the South since the shackles of slavery
had been removed. Those who had been slaves now
stood up men. She felt that there is indeed "a God
who judgeth in the earth, and He only worketh
wonders."</p>

<p>There was comparatively little known among Friends
about the land of the Bible from personal observation
before 1870, and some of the best works on the history,
the geography, the manners, and customs of
Palestine have been written since that date. The
visits of Eli and Sybil Jones to Syria, and the letters
which they and their companions, Alfred Lloyd Fox
and Ellen Clare Peason (born Miller), wrote from
there have done much to bring that country to the
careful notice of Friends; and the interest felt in the
missions at Brumanna and Ramallah has induced
many to study their situations and to become better
acquainted with that whole region, incontestably the
most important on the globe if we associate with the
soil what has transpired there for the benefit of the
race. We call it the "Holy Land," and the religious
enthusiasts of the Middle Ages felt that it was a profanation
for infidels to hold the sepulchre of the Lord
and the cities where He taught; so that thousands
rose from all Christian lands to win back the captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
territory, and blindly gave their lives for what they
thought a sacred cause. In those days the Crusades
opened the eyes of Europe and showed to the people
the civilization and wonders of this Eastern land, and
they brought back accounts from the cradle of early
civilization which changed the thoughts and ideas of
the age. American missionaries began to work in
Syria in 1823, not to win the soil from the hands of
infidels, but to gain the souls of those living in blindness,
ignorance, and sin; and their endeavors have been
greatly blessed, although these strongholds yield slowly
to the most vigorous assaults.</p>

<p>Until the fourth century after Christ feasts were held
annually in Syria to commemorate the death of Adonis&mdash;or
Tammuz, as he was called in Syria&mdash;and his
birth was celebrated again in the spring. These rites
came from the story of Adonis being killed at the
sources of the river which bears his name. This
stream, which comes down with a swollen current
in autumn, carries away much red iron ore; this
gives the water a reddish color, which was said to
be caused by the blood of Adonis, while in the spring
Adonis was supposed to rise from the dead in all his
beauty, at which time all gave themselves up to unrestrained
joy. It was this mourning for Adonis of
which Ezekiel speaks: "He brought me to the door
of the Lord's house, and, behold, there sat women
weeping for Tammuz" (or Adonis). All the heathen
temples were destroyed and the worship stopped by
Constantine the Great. At present there are in Syria
about one million Mohammedans, two hundred and
fifty thousand Maronites, two hundred and thirty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
thousand members of the Greek Church, eighty thousand
Roman Catholics, eighty thousand Druses, thirty
thousand Jews, but only five thousand Protestants;
besides many other kinds of religions.</p>

<p>The Maronites are thought by some to have taken
their name from Maroon, an abbot who lived near the
Orontes in the sixth century. He was considered as
a saint by these people, though by the pope he was
deemed a heretic. In the time of the Crusades the
Maronites joined the Christian army from the West,
and so came in contact with the Roman Church.
They are divided into four orders&mdash;Jesuits, Franciscans,
Lazarists, and Capuchins&mdash;over whom one patriarch
is the governor. The order of the Jesuits, with
the influence of the patriarch, has from the first
opposed the work of all missionaries, and a heap of
stones near the convent of Kanobin marks the spot
where a missionary was martyred in 1830 by the will
of the Maronite patriarch.</p>

<p>The Druses are perhaps the most remarkable people
of Syria, and they are, too, the most mysterious. It
was formerly thought that they were the descendants of
a band of the crusaders who were left behind and finally
forgot their land and religion, taking their name from
the count of Dreux. There is a more plausible theory
which identifies them with some of the tribes introduced
into the Palestine by Esarhaddon, the great
Assyrian, in the seventh century, <small>B. C.</small> Their name
seems to have come from Ismael Darazi, and dates
no farther back than the eleventh century <small>A. D.</small></p>

<p>Hakim, one of the caliphs, who reigned in 1019,
and who seems from his tyranny and fanaticism to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
have been a madman, maintained that he had direct
intercourse with the Deity, and that he was an incarnation
of the divine intelligence. The claim was made
known in the mosque at Cairo by Ismael Darazi, whose
testimony was hostilely received by the people and he
himself compelled to flee; but he at last succeeded in
winning over the ignorant inhabitants of Mount Lebanon,
whence the origin of this religion. The Druses
hold that there is only one God, indefinable, incomprehensible,
ineffable, and passionless&mdash;that he has made
himself known by ten successive incarnations, lastly
by Hakim. They believe in the transmigration of
souls, and they say that virtuous souls pass into Chinese
Druses, but those of the wicked into dogs or camels.
These people have a high reputation for hospitality,
and especially toward the English or Americans. God,
they say, is great and liberal and all men are brothers,
though in their bloody massacres they forget this, as
Christians sometimes do.</p>

<p>The last hundred years have witnessed fearful struggles
between the Maronites and Druses, and the rivers
have run red&mdash;not from the supposed blood of Adonis,
but from that of human beings&mdash;and many Christians
have fallen victims.</p>

<p>Another sad fact is the low position which woman
holds in Palestine. It is only Christianity that can
put her in her true place as man's equal.</p>

<p>Those, then, who go to Syria to herald the gospel
and plant the seeds of progress in the hearts of these
people have as much to contend with as those who go
among uncivilized heathen, or perhaps more. Here
they are opposed by uncompromising bigotry, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
despotic hand of a mighty ruler, and they must find
untold obstacles in a land where the muezzin's voice
is heard from a thousand Moslem minarets, with the
hate which has ever existed between the two religions,
and has not been lessened by the contests around
Jerusalem for the possession of the holy sepulchre.
But missionaries are peacemakers, and it is well that
members of the Society of Friends have been led to
do work here&mdash;a Society which would proclaim the
"truce of God to the whole world for ever;" a Society
which would give to woman the nobility for which she
was created. We may hope that the hills which witnessed
the chorus of angels singing, "Peace on earth, good-will
to men," shall look on a community in which this
is fulfilled, and, though Jerusalem's altar-fires have
gone out, there may a brighter light shine into the
hearts of a people worshipping God in spirit and in
truth.</p>

<p>We can hardly realize that this important land, "the
cradle of revelation," is so small that it is only about
the size of Wales. "From Dan on the north to Beersheba
on the south is a distance of only one hundred
and thirty-nine miles, and the paltry breadth of twenty
miles from the coast to the Jordan on the north increases
slowly to only forty between the shore of
the Mediterranean at Gaza and the Dead Sea on the
south."</p>

<p>To this little country, made great and again humbled,
raised up and again degraded, to this people
divided into so many religions, Eli and Sybil Jones
felt a call to bear the gospel first promulgated from
its hills and in its valleys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>They were liberated by China monthly meeting,
Vassalboro' quarterly meeting, and New England
yearly meeting, and embarked from Boston on the
10th of 4th month, 1867.</p>

<p>"The last meeting attended by them before leaving
their home in Maine was thronged by their townspeople,
many of whom had known them through life,
and several ministers from other societies from the overflowing
of their hearts expressed their desire for the
divine blessing upon their labors as ambassadors for
Christ. Between our two friends, and upon the same
bench, sat their two aged mothers, respectively in their
eighty-fourth and eighty-ninth years. The latter arose
in the presence of the large assembly, and, referring to
the prospect that she should not meet her dear children
again in this life, expressed her willingness to give them
up for the sake of the Lord. They were attended on
board their steamer by a large delegation of Friends
from Lynn, Salem, New Bedford, and Providence.
Here they mingled in Christian sympathy and in a
season of religious fellowship, giving their fellow-passengers
the opportunity of witnessing such brotherhood
in Christ as used in the olden time to induce the
exclamation: 'See how the Quakers love one another!'"
Among those who came to bid them adieu
and attend their religious exercises were John A.
Andrew, governor of Massachusetts, and General
Banks. It was especially interesting, as marking a
striking contrast to the treatment which the missionary
Quakers two hundred years before received at
the hands of the Boston officials.</p>

<p>John G. Whittier, who at one time had a desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
accompany them, wrote the following beautiful verses
for the occasion:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Letters from Eli Jones and his companions will be
given farther on to show the nature of their work,
the places visited, and something of the good accomplished.
Many of these letters are exceedingly interesting,
and, being written on the spots which they
describe, they throw new light on the scenes of the
Bible-land. For the present I wish to follow out
briefly the part these two Friends have taken in what
may be called distinctive mission-work.</p>

<p>After being engaged for about a month attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
meetings in and about London, mostly among the
poor, and doing some work in Scotland, they began
their journey, stopping with the Friends in the south
of France, embarking from Marseilles for Greece, and
thence going pretty directly to Beirut in Syria. They
had as companions and helpers that earnest and sweet-spirited
Christian, Alfred Lloyd Fox of Falmouth,
England, and Ellen Clare Miller of Edinburgh, for
whom, as she is still living, words of eulogy are
happily not yet in place. They spent some months
holding meetings, visiting schools, and doing much
quiet work up and down nearly the whole length of
Palestine. Sybil Jones being all the time in feeble
health, they finally returned to England to spend the
summer. Sybil went to Ireland, and Eli held meetings
in different parts of England. Meantime, Alfred
Fox and Ellen Clare Miller, who had become much
interested in the work going on in Palestine, had raised
a considerable sum of money to assist the mission-schools
and general religious work in the Holy Land,
and about seven hundred pounds were collected, some
of which was sent to those needing it. As the summer
went on, Eli and Sybil Jones each separately,
began to feel that they had still further work in the
East to do, and the way opened for them to return to
the work which they had left unfinished. Ellen Clare
Miller again attended them, also Richard Allen and
Captain Joseph Pim. What money remained was put
into their hands to be spent as they saw fit to promote
education and spread the gospel in Syria.</p>

<p>While in the neighborhood of Jerusalem they visited
Ramallah. There was a boys' school in this place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and here they were met by a young woman who
asked that she might be helped to teach a girls'
school. Eli Jones asked her if she could teach, to
which she answered, yes. After consideration it was
decided to take some of the money which had been
entrusted to them to start this young woman&mdash;Miriam&mdash;in
the work of educating the girls of the neighborhood.
On returning to England at the end of their
visit, and reporting what they had done at Ramallah,
it was at once accepted by the English Friends, and
the little school thus begun was adopted and liberally
supported. Ramallah became the seat of the mission
and school of the London Friends, and was carefully
watched over, built up, and maintained until 1888,
when it was decided to be best for American Friends
to take it in exchange for their interest in the Brummana
mission on Mount Lebanon. It will be called
the Eli and Sybil Jones Mission, and the New England
Friends are ready zealously to take up and carry on
the good work which for eighteen years has received
the support of English Friends.</p>

<p>During this same visit, while at Beirut in the year
1869, they met Theophilus Waldmeier, who was engaged
in the British Syrian schools. He became
much interested in the strangers, and desired to learn
more of their religious principles. "Their addresses
were so powerful and edifying," he writes, "that our
hearts were touched, and I began to think that their
religious principles must be of a superior nature. I
went to the hotel where they lodged and made their
acquaintance, and from that time I have believed that
the Quaker principles are the right basis for a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
spiritual Church. When these dear Friends left the
country their blessed influence remained upon my
heart, though they had not the slightest idea of it,
nor had I any hope of seeing them again."</p>

<p>Two years later Theophilus Waldmeier met Stafford
Allen, and accompanied him, his son, and Joseph Price
to Baalbek, so that they became closely acquainted,
and he was invited to come to Stafford Allen's house
in London, which he did in 1872, and here he made
the acquaintance of Hannah Stafford Allen, Robert
and Christine Alsop, and others, and he became more
and more familiar with the spiritual views of Friends,
and later he joined himself to their Society.</p>

<p>He visited the different missions around Mount
Lebanon, and he found that there was none at Brummana.
It was told him that the inhabitants of Brummana
were the greatest thieves and liars in the world.
"They are Maronites, Greeks, and Druses, and the
evil report of them has filled the country even unto
Egypt. Every one is afraid of them. The American
missionaries wanted to establish a mission among them,
but they were expelled from the place in 1831, and the
Bibles and Testaments which they distributed among
the people were publicly burned." This showed that
here was indeed the spot for a mission, but it would
take courage and manly work to establish it. But the
order seemed to come to Theophilus Waldmeier, "Go
forward;" and on the 9th of the 4th month, 1873, he
gave in his resignation to the committee of British
Syrian schools, and it was not long before he was
settled with his family at Brummana. But, unsupported,
he felt he could do little, and he wrote an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
earnest letter to Hannah Allen for assistance; and
this letter was sent to Eli Jones. Hannah Allen sent
pecuniary aid to Theophilus Waldmeier for his family.
Eli Jones received the letter a little before New England
yearly meeting opened, and took it with him to
that meeting, not knowing what it would be best to
do. Charles F. Coffin attended this yearly meeting, and
he made an earnest plea that New England Friends
should identify themselves with some mission-work.
The subject was taken up and a committee appointed,
the names of Eli and Sybil Jones being among the
number. Eli Jones at once urged that something be
done to help Theophilus Waldmeier, and fifty dollars
was raised to be sent to him. Eli Jones was requested
to write and find how the religious views of Theophilus
agreed with those of Friends, and the answer gave
satisfaction to all. American Friends were now ready
to take hold of the work on Mount Lebanon, and were
anxious to join with English Friends in support of a
mission there. Eli Jones wrote to Theophilus Waldmeier:
"I am glad to be able to say that our Friends
in New as well as in Old England seem much interested
in thy work on Mount Lebanon. I think that
thyself and dear wife and your helpers may be encouraged
to give yourselves to the work of the Lord there,
with full trust that your temporal wants will be supplied."
After much correspondence it was arranged
for English Friends to join those of New England
yearly meeting in furnishing funds for the support of
the new mission; committees, secretaries, and treasurers
were appointed. T. Waldmeier was encouraged
to go on with what he had begun, with the certainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
that his wants would be supplied. He did so, and the
work prospered. He has had much to endure, but he
has persevered, and much of the success of Friends'
work on Mount Lebanon is due to his faithfulness and
courage. English Friends have from the first nobly
done their part to support this post of service, and they
have shown an untiring interest in it. Eli Jones has
felt almost a father's love for this Mount Lebanon
mission. He has worked for it, begged for it, and
prayed for it. His original fifty dollars, collected from
New England Friends, was the first contribution sent
to it, at least by Friends, and from that time on he has
not ceased to stretch out his hands and heart to help it.
He would be the last to claim any honor for the success
of either of the missions in Palestine; he is among
those who have helped to plant and water, and God
himself has given a good increase.</p>

<p>In 1876, Eli Jones, Alfred Lloyd Fox, and Henry
Newman again visited the Holy Land, and especially
the slope of Mount Lebanon. A meeting was held
there, and Eli Jones read an epistle from the foreign
mission committee appointed by New England yearly
meeting, expressing the belief that a meeting should
be organized at Brummana. After deliberation a
meeting was organized in the usual manner, consisting
of six native Christians and the family of T.
Waldmeier.</p>

<p>During this same visit they started a boys' training-home.
The winter was spent in getting the training-home
ready to open and putting it on a proper working
basis. A house was rented from one of the emirs of
Mount Lebanon, in which the boys of the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
began to be trained. This house and the one occupied
by T. Waldmeier were those in which lived the two
emirs who gave the order to burn the Bibles and Testaments
of the early American missionaries. The spot
is still marked near the training-home where these
Bibles were burnt, and some of the inhabitants still
live there who helped execute the order; so that the
children of the men who put fire to the Bible are now
being taught on this same spot from this same book.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1880 an appeal was made for a girls'
training-home at Brummana, T. Waldmeier judging
the cost of building and current expenses would be
about ninety-five pounds. Not long after Eli Jones
wrote: "At our New England yearly meeting thy
appeal for a girls' training-home was read, and elicited
a ready and remarkable response. Soon after the
meeting we found that the subscription had reached
eleven hundred dollars. The women Friends of New
York yearly meeting also raised two hundred dollars,
thus making thirteen hundred dollars in the hands of
our treasurer, George Howland, for the purpose of
erecting a home for girls on Mount Lebanon."</p>

<p>So much money was collected that during the winter
Eli Jones in the name of the committee authorized the
work to begin, and on the 27th of 10th month, 1882,
the new building was completed. Eli Jones, then in
his seventy-sixth year, again crossed the water to be
present at the dedication of it. Three hundred persons,
among them princes and princesses, were there to see
and hear the ceremony. Eli Jones read Prov. xxxi., and
spoke for an hour and fifteen minutes on the subject
of female education. The fifteen girls who were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
educated sat in a semicircle on chairs before Eli Jones,
and stood up and sang a hymn at the close of the
meeting. Charles M. Jones of Winthrop, Maine, had
attended Eli, and they worked for three months to
accomplish the transference of the mission into the
hands of three English and three American trustees.
The management of the work was considerably remodelled
during this winter. It is a difficult matter
to obtain a perfectly clear title to land in Palestine,
and the Friends were obliged to go through eight
different courts before the affair was thoroughly settled.</p>

<p>The Ramallah Friends' mission was visited, and much
was done to encourage the workers there. New England
Friends at present are earnest to accomplish much
good at Ramallah, and there has been a striking liberality
manifested by them in this field. Eli Jones, now
in his eighty-second year, can never again visit in the
body these two spots which he fondly loves, but he
rejoices in his last days that the cause so near his heart
is receiving so warm a support, and the advance which
has been made prophesies the day when the Syrian
wife shall have a woman's voice and a woman's power,
and when the marvellous blessing of Christ's immeasurable
love shall be felt in the hearts of those who
now sit in darkness, though in the land where "the
great Light has shined."</p>

<h3><em>LETTERS FROM SYRIA.</em></h3>


<p>Eli and Sybil Jones were most cordially liberated
by Friends for the work in Europe, which was shown
them as a field white unto harvest in which they were
called to labor. They set sail from Boston in the ship
"China," 4th mo. 10th, 1867. They attended Dublin
and London yearly meetings, and visited the meetings
throughout England, and then carried their labors into
Scotland. Of the visit in this country Eli Jones writes
to the <cite>Friends' Review</cite>:</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, 9th mo. 6, 1867.
</p>

<p>Having returned to this city again from what has
been to us a very pleasant and satisfactory tour throughout
parts of Scotland, and especially to those towns
where members of our religious Society reside, I take
my pen to give a few jottings from my note-book. On
the 12th of 8th mo. we left Newcastle-upon-Tyne for
Glasgow in Scotland, distant by rail one hundred and
twenty-five miles. The day was delightful, and as
we passed on at the rate of thirty or more miles per
hour we saw much calculated to please and instruct.
Crossed the Tweed near its mouth, where the old town
of Berwick enjoys a fine outlook upon the German
Ocean, and where a halt of a few minutes reminded
us that we had really reached the land of Scott and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Burns, of Jaffrey and the Barclays, and of others whose
names are familiar to the readers of Scottish history.
Our course after leaving Berwick lay through extensive
fields of ripening corn&mdash;or, as we Americans would
say, of grain&mdash;interspersed with broad belts of potatoes
and turnips, the whole indicating careful culture and
a higher type of agriculture than I had previously
noticed. As we approached Edinburgh there was
less land under the plough, and instead green pastures
cropped by numerous flocks of sheep, with an occasional
sprinkling of other stock. Passing through the
last-named city, we noticed the monument erected to
the memory of Walter Scott. Its architectural beauty
can hardly fail to catch the eye of the traveller. Another
hour, through a valley of great fertility, brought
us to Linlithgow, the birthplace of Mary queen of
Scots. The royal castle is still standing. At the
close of the day's travel we found ourselves at Glasgow,
and, taking a hurried lunch at the house of William
Smeal, were seated in the meeting of ministers
and elders at the hour of seven, when visitors and
visited were comforted together.</p>

<p><em>13th.</em> Were present at the two-months' meeting&mdash;a
favored season. At a joint meeting following that for
worship the ministry of Eliza Wigham was approved.
It was instructive to witness the freedom of expression,
not only of the aged, but of young men and
women, who cheerfully lent their aid to help the
Church redeem her "charge" in so important a matter.
Attended two meetings in Edinburgh; lodged at the
house of William and Jane Miller. The next day, in
company with these dear friends and others, went by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rail to Aberdeen by way of Stirling, Perth, Dunbar,
and Stonehaven. This ancient city of the North, of
which Alexander Jaffrey was provost (or mayor), and
in whose prisons many of the early Friends were incarcerated
for conscience' sake, is in 57° 8' 57" north
latitude, and lies upon the river Dee. It is built of
gray granite. The houses are from two to four stories
high, and present a clean and substantial appearance.
A statue of Queen Victoria standing near the centre
of the town is much admired. It is of white marble
upon a pedestal of red granite highly polished. In
the chapel at King's College a structure of the fourteenth
century is shown, a pulpit&mdash;a relic from an
ancient cathedral of the twelfth. Great labor must
have been performed by hands no longer active to
produce in the solid oak the carved figures and forms
seen in this edifice of a bygone age. The other college
buildings are of modern date. The general meeting
of ministers and elders was held on the 17th. Godfrey
Woodhard, William Ball, Thomas Wells, and
Sarah Tatham in the ministry were present from England.
The latter has been for some weeks our kind
companion and caretaker.</p>

<p><em>10th, First day.</em> Two meetings for worship were held,
both well attended, the latter more numerously than
could be accommodated in the house, several remaining
near the door; all quiet and attentive. Most
Friends present in the ministry took part in the vocal
exercises, in which Christ was exalted as the rightful
Head of His Church and as the world's only Saviour.
The business of the general meeting is the same in
character as that of a quarterly meeting. It was held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
on the 19th of the month, preceded by a meeting for
worship. We may trust both were seasons of encouragement
to Friends in this land, so remotely situated
one from the other and accustomed to meet for
worship in comparatively small numbers. While in
Aberdeen we visited Barbara Wigham, now nearly
ninety-three years of age, a valued minister who
seems quietly waiting the pleasure of her Lord to
leave her post of watching for a seat among the
blessed. How delightful to look upon the ripe corn
in the ear ready to be garnered! She is the daughter-in-law
of John Wigham, who some years since travelled
extensively in America, going as far east as
Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Left Aberdeen the morning of the 21st for Stonehaven,
sixteen miles distant, where we had arranged
for a meeting in the morning. This is a neat little
town, nearly two miles from Ury, the ancient home
of the Barclays, including the noted Apologist. The
present "laird of Ury," John Baird, and his wife, Margaret
Baird, kindly showed us about their palace-home
and its extensive gardens redolent with fruit and
flower, and in other ways continued to make our
call a very pleasant one. Among things of special
interest was shown a stool of rather clumsy make
labelled "Library Stool of Robert Barclay the Apologist."
Tradition and facts point to this as the veritable
seat of that eminent Christian scholar while writing
his unrefuted and as yet unanswered book, <cite>The
Apology</cite>. A lengthened walk through field and pasture
brought us to the "Sarcophagus" of the Barclay
family, located upon an eminence overlooking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
estate and its surrounding country, including Stonehaven
and parts of the German Ocean. The building
is of stone, with recesses in the interior walls containing
tablets descriptive of members of the family, from
Colonel David Barclay to Robert the Younger, who
died in 1854, there being five in a direct line of the
name of Robert. A larger tablet contains a synopsis
of the history and genealogy of the family, running
back many years prior to the time in which the name
of Barclay finds a place in the history of Friends.
The estate is large. One of its owners during his
life cultivated two thousand acres and planted out one
thousand five hundred other acres. At the time of
our visit its pastures were enlivened by the presence
of large herds of horned cattle and a flock of eight
hundred ewe sheep, four hundred lambs, a portion of
this year's increase having been disposed of previously.
Numerous beeches of startling dimensions grace
the lawn, and near where stood the old homestead an
old yew tree, now in the strength of its power, reminds
one that it might have enjoyed, and probably did enjoy,
youth contemporaneously with the ancient "laird of
Ury" and with his son the Apologist. The present
dwelling is one of modern date; its predecessor and
the "old Ury meeting-house" were removed to give
it place.</p>

<p>Our meeting at Stonehaven was a relieving one.
The family from Ury attended, and we were glad of
their company. Thence we went forward to Glasgow
by way of Dundee, accompanied by our kind friend,
Robert Smeal, the gifted editor of the <cite>British Friend</cite>.
Held large meetings at each of the above-named cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 24th, after a meeting at Kilmarnock, went
that night to Edinburgh. Next day and first of the
week met Friends and others at their place of worship.
Here closed our religious labors in that interesting
country, and we came pretty directly to this
place, taking in meetings at Carlisle, Manchester, and
Birmingham. Affectionately thy friend,</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Eli Jones.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Eli Jones, in a letter dated 9th mo. 26th, thus alludes
to service ahead: "We intend to leave London this
evening for Paris, and after a few days there and
among Friends in the south of France, embark at
Marseilles for Greece; call at a few places in that
classic land; thence pretty directly to Beirut in Syria,
where, if the Lord shall make a way for us to labor in
His service, we may spend some weeks in visiting
school-missionaries and such others as may be disposed
to hear the good news in the land of the Crucified
One, and return by way of Jaffa, Alexandria, Cairo,
and the island of Malta. We have as companions and
helpers in the work our young friends Alfred Lloyd
Fox of Falmouth, England, and Ellen Clare Miller of
Edinburgh. Much kind interest has been manifested
by Friends here in relation to this new field of labor."</p>

<p>One of the companions of E. and S. Jones wrote the
following account of their labors in the south of France
to the <cite>Friends' Review</cite>:</p>

<p>"Eli and Sybil Jones and party left London on the
16th for Paris, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viâ</i> Folkestone and Boulogne, having
letters of introduction from the secretaries of the Turkish
Mission, Church Missionary, and Jewish Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Mission societies, and to various persons in the East.
We had a smooth, pleasant passage of about two hours,
S. J. reclining most of the time, and E. J. and companions
remaining on deck watching the disappearing
lights on the English coast and then those on the
French shore coming into view. We spent the night
in Boulogne, going on the next afternoon to Paris.
The three following days we spent in Paris. We
visited the Exhibition and went to the stand of the
Bible Society, where we were greatly interested in
the account of the work done during the time of the
Exhibition. They have distributed, thus far, 1,800,000
copies of the Scriptures or portions of the Scriptures.
Among others, eight hundred priests have received
these, so that we cannot but hope that a large amount
of good has been effected. While Eli and Sybil Jones
were at the stand numbers of people came for the little
gratuitous French, German, and Italian Gospels, and
seemed much pleased to receive them. Our friends
had the pleasure themselves of giving some copies to
soldiers and others. The gentlemen at the stand were
much interested in E. and S. J.'s mission to the East,
and supplied us with Arabic and Turkish portions for
distribution there. On First day we attended the
Friends' meeting at the Congregational chapel, 23
Rue Royale, at 9 <small>A. M.</small> About forty persons were
present, among others L. Mellor and her husband
from Philadelphia, whom it was pleasant for E. and S.
Jones to meet. The meeting was a memorable and
impressive one, ministry and supplication flowing freely.
Soon after the Friends' meeting the usual Congregational
meeting was held, at which we remained, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
pasteur inviting E. and S. Jones to come to his afternoon
meeting in the Avenue des Ternes, where they
might have an opportunity of addressing those present.
We accordingly went, and found a small but serious
gathering of English and Americans; the song of the
angels on the night of our Saviour's birth was dwelt
upon. Next day E. and S. J., having been invited by
the secretary of the Evangelical Alliance to be present
at the usual service in the Salle Évangélique, we went
thither at the appointed time, but were sorry to find
on arriving that, though free opportunity was offered
for Eli Jones to speak, the committee could not allow
Sybil Jones to do so. Under these circumstances Eli
Jones declined to take any part in a service which
would so distinctly have compromised one of our
Society's leading views. On Third day we left Paris
for Lyons. E. and S. J. much enjoyed the country
with its long lines of poplar trees edging the streams
and canals, and vineyards terracing the slopes of Côte
d'Or. We slept at Lyons, setting out the following
morning for another day's journey to Nismes. Nismes
was reached between nine and ten <small>P. M.</small>, our Friends
less tired than after the journey of the day before,
having much enjoyed the scenery. Jules Paradon,
who for so many years had been an interpreter for
Friends and their kind helper in the south of France,
came early to the hotel on the following morning to
welcome the Friends back to Nismes. Lydia Majolier
and other Friends also called, and an arrangement
was made for a meeting to be held at the Free Church
the same evening, the pasteur kindly giving up his
usual service to E. and S. Jones. A good meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was held, about one hundred being present. Jules
Paradon interpreted the free gospel message and the
prayer for France, her rulers, her pasteurs, and her
people. Much joy was expressed at seeing E. and
S. J. again. Much fruit of their labor here fourteen
years ago is evident. There seems much good
stirring among the young people who are connected
with Friends. Some of those who were at school
when E. and S. J. were last here bear marks of their
influence. On the 3d we drove to Congènies, about
twelve miles from Nismes, through the rich vineyards
and oliveyards of the South. There are not many
Friends at Nismes, but the little meeting-house was
well filled. In the evening a meeting was held, and
about ninety present, half of them men. It was an
interesting sight to see the men in their working dress
and the women&mdash;many of whom had been working
hard all day&mdash;listening so attentively and seriously to
the loving and encouraging words spoken to them.
Much feeling was shown as they spoke to the Friends
after meeting. E. and S. Jones and their party were
kindly lodged at the house of George and Lydia Majolier,
and the following day were driven to Fontanés
to see Friends in that neighborhood. We were hospitably
entertained at the house of Daniel Brun, a
minister of our Society. A meeting was held in the
afternoon, about forty present; L. Majolier interpreted.
E. and S. J. addressed words of warning and encouragement
to all. Daniel Brun prayed for a blessing
upon the seed sown. On First day the meeting convened
at 10.30 <small>A. M.</small> at Congènies, many Friends coming
from other places, so that the little meeting-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was again filled, J. Paradon having come over to interpret.
Sybil Jones dwelt upon the nature of true
worship. Eli Jones dwelt earnestly upon woman's
part in regenerating and elevating the world, reminding
us of what a prominent part she played in the fall,
and, on the other hand, both in the Old Testament
history, and still more in the New, how many noble
women are written about. These were held up as not
unattainable examples. A large and very interesting
meeting was held at 4 <small>P. M.</small> at Nismes in one of the
Protestant places of worship. On Second day E. and
S. J. visited two girls' schools for the poorer classes,
at both of which they spoke to the children, encouraging
them to pray morning and evening for help for
the day and forgiveness for what they had done amiss.</p>

<p>"On Third day we were at St. Gilles, where we were
very kindly entertained at Anna Vally's, where a meeting
was held in the afternoon for the few Friends in
the place, and in the evening a good meeting was held
in the temple. The following day a large meeting was
held at Calvisson, six hundred being there, and Pasteur
Abausit himself interpreting. On Fifth day a farewell
meeting was held with the Friends, thirty or forty in
number, at which much tenderness of feeling was
shown while S. J. urged and encouraged them to fight
for the faith once delivered to the saints. She dwelt
earnestly on the need of their forgiving those who had
injured them, as they hoped to be forgiven. Many
tearful farewells were said and earnest desires expressed
for E. and S. J.'s welfare, and for a blessing
on the labors of their hands. On Sixth day we left
Nismes at noon, reaching Marseilles about 5 <small>P. M.</small>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
whence we hope to sail this afternoon for Athens,
thence to Beirut, where we look to be about the end
of the month."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We give below a letter from Ellen Clare Miller,
written on board the steamer "Godavery" to the
<cite>Friends' Review</cite>:</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Smyrna</span>, 10th mo. 25, 1867.<br />
</p>

<p>It falls to my lot to give some account of the very
interesting visit to Athens of our dear friends Eli and
Sybil Jones.... It was a time never to be forgotten.
Our account was written from Marseilles, from which
port we embarked on Seventh day, 10th mo. 12th,
reaching the Piræus on Fifth day morning. We had
a safe and pleasant voyage, receiving much kindness
from the captain, who seemed a superior man. There
was not opportunity for much outward service on
board, but earnest desires were felt and loving prayers
raised that our tarriance there might be for good to
those who sailed with us....</p>

<p>On the 16th the fine ramparts of the rocky, sterile
hills of Southern Greece came into view, and all that
day we coasted along that most interesting country,
with its mountains rising up from the very edge of
the sea, here and there a poor little village with its
scanty olive trees set in the hollows of the hills, or a
solitary house for the shepherd or goatherd. It was
past midnight when we sailed into the Piræus, very
calm, with beautiful starlight and a very soft air; and
so we landed in Greece.</p>

<p>We did not know quite what we should do, landing
at midnight in a strange country and hearing only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
strange tongue, but we were wonderfully provided for
in this respect. A Greek gentleman, who was our
fellow-passenger returning to Athens, very kindly did
for us all that could be done, getting our baggage
through the custom-house without detention&mdash;which
at that late hour was a great relief&mdash;and taking us to
a comfortable hotel. It is difficult to convey the great
interest of our visit to Athens, which should, I think,
be confirming to all who go in simple faith where they
feel themselves required to go, believing that the way
and the work will be opened up before them. Such has
been everywhere the openness to receive our dear
friends that surely He who put it into their hearts to
visit this place, and who when "He putteth forth His
own sheep goeth before them," prepared the hearts of
the people in a wonderful manner to receive them, and
opened the way for their mission among all. It was
very interesting next morning to find ourselves opposite
the Acropolis with its ancient ruined temples
and fortifications, and the less conspicuous but still
more interesting little eminence beside it, Mars Hill,
from whose rocks, where the council of the Areopagus
sat, Paul spoke.</p>

<p>On Fifth day, the 17th, Eli Jones and Alfred Lloyd
Fox delivered letters of introduction to J. H. Hill,
chaplain of the English embassy, who for more than
thirty years, with his wife, has been teaching the Greek
children. There is a great work going on in Athens
in reference to the poor Cretans who have fled from
their own islands and taken refuge in Greece. Thousands
have come to Athens, where they have been
provided with food and clothing, and schools have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
been opened for the education of their children. We
visited five of these&mdash;some more than once&mdash;where E.
and S. Jones had an opportunity of speaking to the
children, and often to the poor Cretan women. Some
were widows; others had lost their children, others
whose husbands and children are still engaged in the
war. All had lost their homes and their whole possessions.
It was a very affecting sight to see these
poor sorrowing creatures thronging to speak to the
friends, thanking them for their words of loving sympathy
and comfort, and for the help and sympathy
sent them from America. At all the schools the
message of our dear friends was to point both children
and parents to Jesus as the one who is able
under all circumstances to give peace and happiness
to the soul. The message, which to many was a
new one, seemed to go home to their hearts, and seed
was sown with fervent prayer which we must believe
will be blessed to these poor creatures and to Greece
by Him who giveth the increase. Demetrius Z. Sackellarios,
editor of <cite>The Star in the East</cite> and treasurer of
the American and Greek fund for the support of the
Cretan schools, very kindly and efficiently interpreted
on several occasions. He is a Greek by birth, but
spent several years in America, and his wife, A. Josephine
Sackellarios, is an American lady. There are
indeed several Americans in Athens, with whom we
had some very delightful intercourse.</p>

<p>We spent First day evening with Dr. Hill and his
family, and (through the medium of Edward Masson,
a Scotchman, and formerly one of the judges of the
supreme court of Areopagus) E. and S. Jones had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
opportunity of addressing a school at Dr. Hill's house
for between twenty and thirty Greek girls of the upper
classes. Several were introduced to them from Macedonia,
Asia Minor, and many parts of Greece and the
islands, besides Athens. An impression seemed to be
made that evening which we trust will not soon be
forgotten. After visiting another of the schools on
First day, where we saw five hundred children taught
on the national-school system, and some Cretan women
spinning and weaving their native silk, we went to the
prison, where Sybil Jones had obtained permission to
speak to the prisoners. Leave was granted for all the
prisoners, about one hundred and fifty in number, to
come into the courtyard, in the centre of which was a
large plane tree, under the shadow of which all stood,
the poor men forming a large semicircle around S.
Jones and D. Sackellarios, her interpreter, and the
others. It was a striking scene and a time of great
interest. The men were exceedingly attentive, and
many were moved while S. J. spoke to them for nearly
an hour. She sympathized with them in their present
condition. She related some narratives of prisoners
who, having found their Saviour in prison, had been
filled with joy, and she prayed for them that they too
might be brought to Him. The governor of the
prison seemed very grateful&mdash;said he hoped the words
spoken would be blest to the souls of the poor prisoners;
and many said it was a day never to be forgotten.
It was found that the prisoners had no Bibles,
but an arrangement was made that each should be
supplied with at least a Gospel. We spent the evening
very pleasantly at the house of Dr. Kalopothakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
where we met most of the missionaries, to whom, after
the First of Romans had been read, E. and S. J. addressed
many words of encouragement, as they did
on a similar occasion on Third day morning, when
many came to the hotel to take leave, alluding to the
refreshment it had been in coming to a strange land
to meet with those to whom, as servants of the same
blessed Master, they could feel united in one common
love and faith, partaking together of the one true communion
and speaking together the language of Canaan.
All present were deeply affected, and a strong impression
was made there as on all other occasions. Some
said that the visit of these dear Friends to Athens was
just what they had long desired and prayed for&mdash;that
what they had brought was as a message from the
Saviour to encourage them in their work; and D.
Sackellarios said that the day of his interpreting for
them was the happiest of his life. The same morning
E. and S. Jones visited the theological college for the
education of young Greek priests. It is under the
superintendence of a young Greek, who seems a serious
man. He has one or two Friends' books, and is
desirous to know something of our Society. S. J.
addressed a few words both to him and to the students,
encouraging them to give their hearts to the Saviour
and to attend to the teaching of the Holy Spirit in
their hearts.</p>

<p>E. and S. J. also received a visit from the Cretan
bishop of Kissaruss to thank them for their visits to
the schools and their interest in the Cretan children,
and through them to express gratitude to the American
people for their help and sympathy. He also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
asked for the prayers of Americans that Crete might
be made free.</p>

<p>We sailed from the Piræus 10th mo. 22d, landing at
Syra the following morning, where E. and S. J. visited
the school for Greek children under the care of F. A.
Hildner, a Basle missionary, who has been for thirty-seven
years engaged in work on this island. Here, as
before, the gospel message was spoken to the children
and a cheering visit paid to the missionary. We re-embarked
on Fifth day, and after running for some
time pretty near the coast we sailed into the beautiful
bay on which Smyrna stands. The city looks bright
and Eastern with its light-painted, square, flat-roofed
houses, among which towers and minarets rise. Behind
the city rises a steep bare hill crowned with a
mosque and the ruins of an old castle. The mountains
rise all round the bay, greener than any we had
seen since leaving the south of France, and with olive
trees and vineyards round their base.</p>

<p>To-day, the 25th, we went on shore, and were driven
up and down the narrow, roughly-paved streets of
Smyrna, in which we saw many sights reminding us
we were in Asia&mdash;the trains of laden camels, the veiled
Turkish women, the fine large cypress trees shading
the graveyards with their painted inscriptions in
foreign characters. We visited the deaconesses' home,
where fourteen of the sisterhood educate between
two hundred and three hundred children, many of
the upper class. The establishment is in beautiful
order, and a bright and Christian spirit appeared to
reign in it. We hope to-morrow to continue the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
voyage to Beirut. Our dear friends are pretty well,
though needing rest. Thine sincerely,</p>

<p>Ellen Clare Miller writes again in 11th mo. to the
<cite>Friends' Review</cite>:</p>

<p class="head">
<span class="smcap">Beirut</span>, Syria.<br />
</p>

<p>The account of the journey of our dear friends E.
and S. Jones was brought down to the time of our
leaving Smyrna. Having now reached Beirut in
safety, they wish thee and their friends in America to
know as soon as may be of their welfare, and of the
pleasant and very interesting voyage which we were
favored to make safely and comfortably. Since our
arrival here, on Sixth day, the weather has been so
broken and stormy that we do indeed feel that there
is great cause for thankfulness to Him who holds the
winds and waters under His control.</p>

<p>We sailed from Smyrna about noon on the 26th,
gradually losing sight of the beautiful mountains which
rise up on the south-west side of the bay with their
fine coloring of gray, pink, green, and purple, which
gives such a charm to the hills about this coast. We
passed Chios and Samos&mdash;Patmos with its great interest
as the isle to which the beloved disciple was
banished by the emperor Domitian, and where the
wonderful visions were revealed to him. The following
day, First day, the 27th, we reached Rhodes, and,
the steamer stopping for a few hours, we went on shore,
going up the steep street where on either hand stand
the half-ruined, strongly-built castles and houses once
occupied by the Knights of St. John. Over each doorway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
may still very plainly be seen the various coats-of-arms
of the members of the order, the grand master
having a larger house and more elaborate escutcheon.
We passed a mosque at the time when the congregation
were coming out, and saw each man resume his
shoes at the door; there were no women. We were
allowed to look inside, but not to enter more than a
step or two. It was a plain, whitewashed building,
with matting, but no seats; texts from the Koran
painted here and there upon the walls, and a kind of
pulpit from which the Koran is read. There are many
Jews and Mohammedans at Rhodes. It was sorrowful
to think how many there were who were professing to
worship God, but in so mistaken a manner. E. Jones
and A. Fox distributed a great many portions of Scripture
and tracts in Arabic, Turkish, and Hebrew, as
they did all along the coast at our various stopping-places,
so sowing much good seed, some of which at
least may, we hope, take root and bear fruit.</p>

<p>The whole of the following day was spent in coasting
along that part of Anatolia formerly called Lycia,
Pamphylia, and Cilicia, keeping very near the shore.
It was a great privilege to pass near scenes of such
interest as those regions through which Paul and his
companions passed, and to see the very places on
which their eyes must have rested. Cyprus was
visible on the right, but too distant from us to obtain
much idea of its appearance. Early in the morning
of the 29th we found ourselves in the harbor of Mersina,
the port of Tarsus, about ten miles from that
city, of which Paul was a citizen. This latter place
itself we could not see, but we were shown the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in which it lay among the mountains, and the
point where the Cydnus flows into the sea with its
cold waters fresh from Taurus, whose snowy tops we
plainly saw. The ship remained here till the afternoon,
shipping wheat, and we were much interested
in seeing a train of one hundred and fifty camels
winding down from the direction of Taurus and moving
slowly along the shore to discharge their freight
at the warehouses upon the quay. We then turned
our faces southward, passing not far from Antioch,
which, however, cannot be seen from the sea. We
stopped a few hours at Latakia, near which rises the
cone-shaped Mount Cassius. Soon after passing this
we had our first view of one of the spurs of Mount
Lebanon, crowned with snow. This grand and extensive
range became more and more conspicuous
until we reached Tripoli, which lies beautifully at its
feet in a fine wide bay. We sailed very near the island
of Aradus, the ancient Arvad, opposite to which lies
"the entering in of Hamath" so often mentioned in
the Bible, the boundary of the Land of Promise,
though never of that really possessed by the Israelites.
The weather was very fine, but extremely hot,
all the time we were on the water.</p>

<p>The first day we were in Beirut the sirocco was
blowing a hot, enervating wind. Beirut looks beautiful,
either from the sea or land. It is built along the
shore at the foot of Mount Lebanon. We find several
American and English missionaries, many of whose
schools we have visited and have been much interested
in them; also attended some religious meetings. As
it is the rainy season, the Friends are not able to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
on quite so fast with their work as might otherwise
be the case; but they have been warmly received, and
their visit seems to be a very opportune one. Our
party are all in usual health. The dear Friends think
their health is improved, decidedly so, since they left
America.</p>

<p class="center">Thine sincerely,</p>

</p>

<p>Another letter from Ellen Clare Miller, from Mount
Lebanon in 11th mo., 1867, to the editor of the <cite>Friends'
Review</cite>, says:</p>

<p>"The last account forwarded to thee of our dear
friends E. and S. Jones was brought down to the 12th
of this month. The great storms which had prevailed
up to that time, severer for the season than had been
known for many years, passed away on that day. A
remarkably fine rainbow, double and sixty degrees in
height, one foot resting on the sea and the other on
the base of Lebanon, appeared that evening just before
sunset, giving very welcome promise of the return of
fine weather. This was very cheering, as the heavy
rains had for the time suspended the work of visiting
schools, except that of E. B. Thompson, which adjoins
M. Mott's house. We are not able yet to give a very
clear statistical account of the many schools in Beirut
and Lebanon for the education of boys and girls, but
there is, indeed, a great work going on through their
agency&mdash;a work of very widely extended influence.
E. B. Thompson has fourteen schools under her influence,
some in Beirut, some in the mountains. E.
Saleeby, a Syrian, who has spent some time in Scotland
and England, and whose efforts are principally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
supported by subscriptions from the former country,
has many more under his care. The American missionaries
have stations at Beirut and in several towns
in the mountains, and we are at present at a boarding-school
for training Syrian girls for teachers, conducted
by two young ladies from England, sent out by the
Society for Promoting Female Education in the East.
They have at present only eighteen girls, on account of
their limited means; the school will accommodate thirty,
and the education given and the Christian influence
extended, here as at other schools which we have seen,
are very telling, and are raising the women to a very
different position from that which they formerly occupied
even among the nominal Christians in the country.
The prejudice against their education was very great
among all sects, and still exists, from the Mohammedans,
who believe that woman has no soul, among
the Druses, Maronites, and Catholics, and the somewhat
more enlightened Protestants, who are now,
through these schools, awaking to the advantage of
having their daughters educated.</p>

<p>"The people everywhere seem very intelligent, and
there seems much openness to receive missionaries
from the Society of Friends, whose spiritual teaching
is much needed in these parts; and we hope the feet
of some may be directed to this Bible land, where the
fields are already white unto harvest and the laborers
few, and that Friends may see their way to lend funds
to carry on this great work of Christian education
among the females of the East. There is an innate
nobility in them, and a gentleness and warmth of feeling
in the women, which, when so developed, produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a fine character. Those who cannot speak English
look at us with eyes full of love and interest, and by
their expressive gestures convey more than many of
our words would do. We became much interested in
the girls of E. B. Thompson's principal school, which
we frequently visited, Eli Jones taking the Scripture
class several times. He found their knowledge of
the Bible and their understanding of its truths equal,
if not superior, to what we should find in our own
schools in America and England. Besides this school,
E. and S. J. visited the infant school in connection with
it, also three smaller branch schools under E. B.
Thompson's direction, and a boys' school conducted
by two very superior young men, native teachers, but
also under her superintendence. They also went to
the Prussian Deaconesses' Institution, where the children
receive a good education under Christian influences;
then to the school for girls under the care of
Dr. Bliss, the American missionary: of this latter a
native Syrian and his wife have the immediate superintendence,
residing in the house with the boarders.
The children everywhere are well instructed in the
Bible, and commit a great deal to memory both from
the Arabic and English Scriptures. In all the schools
the Friends delivered their message, exhorting all to
use diligence to advance in their education, that through
the instrumentality of her young men and young women
Syria may rise among nations, and encouraging them
to seek earnestly and prayerfully after a knowledge of
Him without knowing whom, with all their learning
and knowledge, they cannot be truly great&mdash;often
kneeling in prayer with the teachers and scholars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
before leaving the school. They attended also a
meeting for the Home Mission Society, where they
addressed, through the medium of M. Bosistani, its
principal, the college for the education of Syrian
young men, as well as the American and E. B.
Thompson's school, who were all present.</p>

<p>"On Sixth day morning we started for Sook-el-Gharb,
a little village twelve miles from Beirut on the
side of Lebanon, two thousand feet above the sea,
where we intended to remain an hour or two visiting
the schools there, and then to continue our journey
a little farther to a village which we might make our
headquarters while visiting the schools in that neighborhood,
it being considered that the mountain-roads
would have sufficiently recovered from the effects of
the storm to be passable. The wind and the rain had,
however, been so much more violent than is usual at
this season that the road was much worse than had
been expected, the path being in some places washed
away by the torrents, which, wearing themselves a
rough channel down what had been the road, had
thrown up a wall of large loose stones on each side,
making the journey in some parts dangerous, and so
fatiguing that Sybil Jones was very much exhausted
on arriving at Sook, and unable to proceed farther
without a rest of two or three days. As much care
as possible had been used in getting her up the mountain,
riding being the only means of travelling on these
steep, rough mountain-roads, with their ascents and
descents more precipitous than can be well imagined
without being seen; but the shaking and exertion were
quite too much for her back, unused to such exercise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and she was confined to bed, suffering much from pain
and weakness, until Third day, the 19th, when she was
carried in a chair to this place, twenty minutes' ride distant
from Sook, by a comparatively level path. The exertion
of this so tired her that with great reluctance she
had to decide that she must give up the prospect of
going farther into the mountains. Eli Jones and A.
L. Fox are accordingly visiting the various mountain-schools,
while she is remaining at the school in Shumlan.
It is a great disappointment and a trial of faith to
both the dear Friends that it has thus been ordered
so differently from what had been planned; but we
cannot but believe that it will be overruled for the
best. The ride from Beirut to Sook-el-Gharb is a
very interesting one. We halted for some time at a
little rude khan at the side of a little stream of clear
cold water, where we rested a while under the shade
of a fine evergreen oak, and had some refreshments,
being offered cakes of the Arab bread, which is very
thin and flat and baked of coarse flour, producing the
effect of a small sheet of chamois leather; though
rather tough, it is sweet and quite edible, and in constant
use in this part of the country. They tear off a
piece, roll it up, and dip it into their food, instead of
using knives and forks; and we were much interested
in hearing that it was still the practice in doing honor
to another at table to present him with such a piece
dipped in the choicest part of the mess, reminding us
of our Saviour's gift to Judas. Our view from this
village is very fine. We look down on the Mediterranean,
ten miles or more distant, but looking in this
deceptive atmosphere not more than three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
miles off. Between us and it intervene the terraced
sides of Lebanon, laid out in mulberry-gardens or
newly sown with wheat. Our stay at Sook, though
unintentional, seemed to be in right ordering, for service
opened up there. The mistress of the house
where we were, E. Saleeby's wife, was dangerously ill,
and has since died, and her husband felt the dear
Friends' visit one of great comfort and entertained
us with much kindness. E. Jones and A. Fox visited
the boys' and girls' school there, as well as at Abeih
and Bhamdûn, some hours' ride from Sook, E. J.
examining the children in Scripture and in other
branches, speaking to and praying with them, and
distributing English and Arabic books. He also
held meetings at Sook and Shumlan in the school-house,
attended by the schools and several of the
villagers, where the words earnestly spoken were
attentively and gladly received. We have heard
twice from E. J. and A. L. F. since they left us&mdash;good
accounts. We were hoping to have seen them back
last evening, but they did not appear. We suppose
that they must have gone farther than was at first
intended."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is a letter from Eli Jones, written to
the <cite>Friends' Review</cite> a few days later than the above
letter from E. C. Miller:</p>


<p class="center">SYRIA AND PALESTINE.</p>


<p class="head">
<span class="smcap">Shumlan</span>, 12th, 21st, 1867.
</p>

<p>My dear Sybil feeling unable to go farther over these
almost trackless mountains without time for more rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
it seemed best for her and E. C. Miller to remain at
the boarding-school for girls at this place under the
care of two English ladies, Lucy Hicks and Mary M.
Jacombs, while A. L. Fox and I should proceed in
the work. Accordingly, on the 22d of last month we
left at eight o'clock in the morning on horseback,
attended by an efficient dragoman named Georgius,
an interpreter, Ibrahim, and Abdallah and Hassan,
muleteers. After a ride of two hours we reached
Abeih, and were kindly cared for at the house of
Simon Calhoun and wife, American missionaries. He
has been many years in this country, and is, we learn,
much esteemed by all classes. Our first call was at
the school of the Druses. The provost of the school
and the teacher of English met us at the gate and gave
us a cordial welcome; then led us to an apartment
where sweetmeats and coffee in tiny cups, according
to the custom of the country, were served. In answer
to our question whether the Holy Scriptures were read
in the school, the teacher of English assured us that
they were read by his class. He is a student from the
American school, and will do what he can, I doubt not,
in his delicate position to inculcate Christian sentiment
among this peculiar people.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we visited the boys' and also the
girls' school, under the care of the American mission,
and were pleased with the advance they have made in
their education: we spoke to the children in each
school, William Bird interpreting, as he did in the
evening, when we met the young men at the Abeih
seminary for the education of native teachers. This
institution has been in successful operation for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
last twenty-five years. Each student is expected to
devote from one to two hours each day to the study
of the Holy Scriptures. These students may now be
met in almost all parts of Syria and in Mesopotamia
and Egypt.</p>

<p><em>Seventh day, 23d.</em> Rode to Deir-el-Kamr; found
lodgings at the school-house, where E. B. Thompson
has a small school. After dinner took an hour's ride
to Beteddin; called at the palace of Douad Pasha,
governor of the pashalic of the Lebanon. The governor
was not at home; we were met by some of his
subordinate officers, with whom we had interesting
discourse.</p>

<p><em>First day, 24th.</em> At an early hour we mounted our
trusty steeds, and reached Mukhtârah about ten <small>A. M.</small>
Riding up to the palace of the great Druse chief, Said
Beg Jumplatt, we found the two young princes about
to set out on a ride to pass the day with friends in a
neighboring town, accompanied by N. Gharzuzee, the
tutor of the younger prince, and other officials. They
offered us the hospitalities of the house as long as we
were disposed, which we accepted, and were soon informed
that the princes had given up their anticipated
pleasure, saying they preferred to spend the time with
us. The elder prince is nearly eighteen years of age,
and married; the younger is about thirteen years old,
bright and intelligent, and really "the hope of my
house." His tutor, N. Gharzuzee, who is a native
of Syria, has spent several months in England; he
speaks our language well and appears to be an earnest
Christian. As Christians we could not fail to feel
greatly interested in seeing such a man in so important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a position, where he is teaching this young
man, destined, so far as we can see, to fill the highest
place of influence among this heterodox people&mdash;not
only sciences and languages, but the pure and unsophisticated
doctrines of the Bible. At one <small>P. M.</small> we
met the children of the American mission and of E.
M. Thompson's schools, with several of the parents.
After listening to a very satisfactory examination of
the children in the Scriptures, I addressed them, N.
Gharzuzee interpreting in an able manner. The meeting
was one to which I recur with sincere satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>25th.</em> Had our morning reading in Arabic, after
which prayer was offered in English, in which strong
desires were expressed in the name of Jesus, on behalf
of the young princes, for the various members of the
household and for Syria. We left after many a cordial
shake of the hand and with many a "God bless
you!" and "May you return to your own country in
peace!" Near one o'clock <small>P. M.</small> we saw in the distance
the snow-clad top of Hermon, which we seemed
approaching. What thoughts filled our minds&mdash;thoughts
too big for utterance&mdash;as we stood upon
"the heights of that goodly mountain Lebanon,"
and saw the noble cone of Hermon rising majestically
toward the meridian sun, while southward
near its base lay the division of Naphtali, a portion
of the "land of possession," where we hoped to
arrive on the following day! "The north and the
south, Thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon
shall rejoice in Thy name."</p>

<p>Passed near a peasant at work with a curious plough
drawn by a pair of tiny bullocks. We each took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
turn in guiding the plough, and felt a pleasure for the
time in occupying a place so often honored by prophets
and good men of old in this historic land. About the
time of the going down of the sun we reached Jezzin.
Weary from the long journey, I lay for a time upon a
rug near the fountain while our dragoman went to
look for lodgings. During that brief time many a
maiden came forth with her pitcher to draw water.
What strong evidence this that we are nearing the
Bible land! Lodgings were soon announced. On
reaching the room intended for our reception we
found several members of the family busily engaged
in covering the floor with matting, and near the seat
of honor a fine carpet was spread. Presently, finding
I was weary, a thin mattress&mdash;or perhaps, as would be
better understood in our country, a thick comfortable&mdash;was
added as a bed. Here, stretching my weary
limbs, I sought needed rest. By the time, however,
that we were fairly domiciled a large circle of men
came in and engaged in their favorite occupation,
smoking. Though the fumes of the pipe have for us
no attraction, but rather the contrary, still, finding our
neighbors inclined to be social, we strove to make the
conversation profitable and if possible edifying. In
the course of the evening our kind hostess inquired
if we would like water for our feet? On our replying
in the affirmative, "a lordly dish" well filled was
brought, and we were told all things were ready.
Think what must have been our surprise on being
told that the young woman standing near had volunteered
to wash the strangers' feet! Fearing that
our refusal might be misunderstood, we placed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
at the disposal of the "little Syrian maid." With
what thrilling interest ought we hereafter to read the
account of what transpired when He whose blood
cleanses from all sin "girded Himself and washed
His disciples' feet," saying to them, "If I then, your
Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also
ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given
you an example that ye should do as I have done
unto you!"</p>

<p>The morning of the 26th the priest of the place
came in, with whom we had some pleasant intercourse.
After breaking our fast we told the family that it was
our practice, before proceeding on the journey of the
day, to read a portion of Scripture and endeavor to
lift up our hearts to God in prayer, and we gave them
an invitation to be present. They all remained with
us, as did the priest. We need not inquire to what
society these people belonged; suffice it to say, they
entertained strangers, they washed our feet, they fed
the hungry, they bade us go in peace, and refused our
money as a recompense. After a ride of two hours
we halted at Cafer Huney, a little village on our route,
to have our horses' feet examined by a blacksmith
and shoes set if needful. While waiting we went to
the fountain, where several persons collected. After
a time spent in pleasant conversation we spoke to them
of the heavenly country and of salvation by Jesus
Christ. We left with them copies of our Lord's
miracles in Arabic, which they received gladly. One
of these rustic villagers, a lame man, offered me his
cane as a walking-stick with such hearty good-will,
saying he had others at home, that I took it and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
it very useful in making the steep descent of Lebanon
in the afternoon. Near sunset we reached the foot of
the Lebanon range, and then crossed the Litany (named
on many maps Leontes) on one of the few bridges to
be found in this country. An hour and a half more
brought us to the little town of Abbel, toward which
we had looked as an Arab village where it might be
difficult to find secure and comfortable lodging for the
night. Ere we entered all was shrouded in darkness,
for the night had set in, but, as it proved, a glad surprise
awaited us. In reply to our first inquiry for
lodgings we were told that "the American church
would be the best place for us to stop at." A little
farther on we were accosted by one with whitened
locks, who, taking our hands, shook them with both
of his with brotherly cordiality, and then with a light
led the way to the comfortable house erected within
the past year as a place for worship and a school-house
by that devoted band of men whose praise is in all the
churches in this land&mdash;the American missionaries. By
the time we had entered several of the brethren had
arrived. The house is without seats. Mats were
quickly arranged for us; then followed the arrangements
for supper. A <em>canoon</em> filled with charcoal with
which to heat the water for tea first arrived; then one
brought bread, another eggs, a third sugar, and another
melons; and <em>such melons</em>! worthy the land that produced
them. All things being ready, the travellers sit
upon the floor about the inviting meal, and while they
are busily engaged in satisfying the calls of hunger the
company increases; and here our responsibilities widen,
for as we have been privileged to partake of their good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
things for the sustenance of the body, we are in duty
bound, as far as may be our power, to meet their spiritual
and intellectual wants. I trust this evening, our
first in Palestine, was spent to the mutual benefit of all
concerned. On the morning of the 27th the school-children
and several of the parents came in, to whom
we spoke words of encouragement in the pursuit of
useful knowledge, and especially that which "maketh
wise unto salvation." An hour more brought us to
Krhyam, where we met another school. We spoke to
them of Him who is the only "Hope of Israel." Again
in the saddle, we rode away across the extensive and
fertile valley of Marjaiyum.</p>

<p>Just before reaching D'Mimas we met William Eddy
of New York State, a minister in connection with the
American mission. On learning our intentions, he
kindly proposed to return to D'Mimas, that he might
be with us during our stay; his presence and kind
care contributed largely to our comfort. Here we
visited another school and met several of the brethren
socially. The subject of education, and especially the
education of women, was freely discussed. We endeavored
to show them that no people can be happy
or prosperous while woman holds a degraded position
among them, and that it is in vain to look for great
men where good and virtuous mothers are not to be
found. As we press onward what a view opens before
us! One short hour farther we stand upon a rocky
knoll near the ancient town of Abel, where Joab
claimed Sheba the son of Bichri as a condition of
peace. Looking eastward, toward our right are the
hills of the ancient Bashan, thickly dotted with oaks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
those emblems of strength; toward the left Hermon
lifts his head to heaven in solemn and solitary majesty.
Not far are the sites where stood Laish, Dan, and
Cæsarea Philippi of the Scriptures, which we hope
to visit before nightfall, and all around on either hand
we have spread out before us one of the great battlefields
of the Bible. We spent a short time in the town
distributing a few Arabic books, and met with, as far
as we could learn, the only school-teacher, who told
us he had under his instruction fourteen boys. We
tried to give him encouragement in the work, and
gave him a copy of the Psalms.</p>

<p>Soon after mid-day we reached Tell-el-Kady, "the
hill of the judge," the Dan of Scripture. Two things
are here worthy of special notice: the fountain of the
Jordan and the site of the ancient city of Dan. The
Tell is cup-shaped, and bears evidence of being an
extinct crater. On an island of rocks in size little
more than sufficient to accommodate our party, and
beneath the wide-spreading branches of an ancient
oak, we took our humble mid-day meal. We had
scarcely begun to satisfy our own appetites when a
mounted Arab, armed to the teeth, rode up and asked
for food, to whom we gladly gave a portion, for, once
fed from our store, he becomes an ally, not a foe. Perhaps
I ought here to add that on our way to this place
from Abel we were accosted by an armed Arab, who
demanded "backsheesh" as I rode abreast of him:
feeling that we owed him naught but love and good-will,
we gave him no money, and were suffered to pass
without further molestation. The ruin of the ancient
city of Dan is very complete; a few broken walls, fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
stones, and pieces of pottery are all that are left to tell
of a people long since passed away.</p>

<p>The story of Dan is soon told. Originally an agricultural
colony of the Ph&oelig;nicians, called Lessem or
Laish, it was captured by six hundred Danites from
the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol. The capture of
Laish by the Danites in the north was the fulfilment of
Moses's prophetic blessing to the tribe: "Dan is a lion's
whelp; he shall leap from Bashan." Deut. xxxiii. 22.</p>

<p>Another hour's ride brought us to Banias, standing
amid the ruins of the ancient Cæsarea Philippi. The
modern village is inhabited by some one hundred
persons of the Moslem faith, who live in wretched
ignorance and poverty. We lodged at the house of
the sheik; a room was assigned us and mats spread.
There we stretched our weary limbs, but, as the sequel
proved, not so much to sleep as to contemplate upon
the fact that we had nearly reached the base of Hermon
and the site of Cæsarea Philippi, and upon the record
that our Lord, after healing the blind man at Bethsaida,
"came into the coast of Cæsarea Philippi"&mdash;that not
far from this place He made that striking appeal to
His disciples: "Whom say ye that I am?" and soon
after, taking three of His disciples, "He went up into
a mountain, and was transfigured before them." Yes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">"I tread where the Twelve in their wayfaring trod,</div>
<div class="line">I stand where they stood with the Chosen of God&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Where His message was heard and His lessons were taught,</div>
<div class="line">Where the blind were restored and the healing was wrought."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The next morning, before leaving, we conversed
with a son of the sheik, himself a husband and father,
upon the importance of education. He acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
his own inability to read, and further said that the
children were all needed by their parents to work;
and as to woman, her business was to care for the
house and meet the wants of men, and if she did not
do this well she must be beaten to make her do it.
Such is the state of civilization where once stood a
great and prosperous city, whose architectural ruins
attest the fact that its citizens must have been men
of skill and taste. Again in the saddle, we turned
our course northward. Near noon we ascended a
high elevation, where our dragoman halted and called
out, "Look! look!" Facing southward, we looked
and saw Hermon on our left standing in majestic
greatness, and beyond, far to the south, the waters
of the Sea of Galilee. Mid the glare of a noonday
sun the little sea seems a molten mass of silvery hue.
We have within the scope of our vision a mountain
whose name is accepted as a word of beauty, a valley
of great natural fertility, and the arena of mighty
deeds done by men whose record is found in the
"Book of books," and whose God is the Lord. Here
young Jordan springs into life and links its destiny
with the waters of Merom, and onward the eye stretches
to that now placid sheet where in a dark and stormy
night the chosen band were troubled, and where a
compassionate Saviour allayed their fears.</p>

<p>We dined at Rasheiyet,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> at the house of a native
Protestant minister, where we were kindly entertained.
He accompanied us to the school of the American
mission. We were pleased with what we saw, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
especially with the students' knowledge of scriptural
history. Several hours more brought us to Hasbeiya;
we lodged at the school-house and had our mats
spread upon the seats, thus extemporizing a bedstead.
Next morning about twenty of the girls came
in to meet us, and also two of the female teachers. We
spoke of the way of life and salvation, with such words
of encouragement as we found in our hearts. A ride
of several hours brought us to Rasheyyá el-Wady. We
lodged at the house of one Moses, the first person of
the place who embraced Protestant views.</p>

<p>Next day, 1st of 12th mo., held a meeting at the
school-house. I felt strengthened, as I trust, to
preach "Christ, and Him crucified," as the only
way of life and salvation. On the following day at
an early hour we passed out of the town by the light
of a lantern. At half-past one <small>P. M.</small> we began to ascend
Lebanon. At one place near the top we found
our path literally strewed with fossils (bivalves); some
of these we collected to take home with us. After a
journey of nearly fifteen hours we reached Shumlan,
our mountain-home, and were glad to find our companions
in comfortable health, and I trust a feeling of
thankfulness was felt to our heavenly Father for His
protecting care so mercifully granted during our separation.
Very sincerely, thy friend,</p>

<p>We give below some extracts from letters written to
the <cite>Friends' Review</cite> by Ellen Clare Miller, giving a
definite account of the number and working of the
schools in Beirut and Lebanon for the education of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the young sons and daughters of Syria. E. and S.
Jones have visited the greater number of them, and
found many different kinds of laborers&mdash;Americans,
English, Scotch, and Syrian&mdash;all doing a good work
for the land:</p>

<p>"Most of those among the natives who are true
Christians, and who are exerting a good influence
upon the people here, refer gratefully to the American
missionaries as those who were instrumental in
bringing them to the truth. The American mission
has stations at many places among the mountains,
most of which have been visited by Eli Jones and A.
L. Fox; and besides those in the north of Syria, which
we shall not see, they have three in Sidon and its
neighborhood under the care of W. Eddy, which we
hope soon to visit. The Syrian Protestant college of
which Dr. Bliss is president is an institution where
Druses, Maronites, Greeks, Armenians, and Protestants
together receive a literary, scientific, and medical
training under Protestant influence. E. and S.
Jones visited this college last week, when they met
twenty-eight of the young men, whom they were invited
to address. Eli Jones set before them clearly
and forcibly the great power of individual influence
possessed by each student, the influence their institution
must exert on the land, the measure it was of the
power of the country, as no stream can rise higher
than its source, and as the fountain is the stream will
be. Sybil Jones, as an American mother who knew
much of such institutions in her own land, affectionately
urged them to work perseveringly and prayerfully
in their studies, that each one might leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
world better for his having been in it. It was a very
interesting visit; the young men, a fine, intellectual-looking
company, listened with great attention, and
afterward gathered round the Friends to express their
thanks for their kind interest in them.</p>

<p>"There is a large girls' school in Beirut, under the
immediate care of a Syrian and his wife, but superintended
by the wife of Dr. Bliss, Dr. Thompson's wife,
and other ladies. This we have visited more than
once, when E. and S. Jones have spoken to the children."</p>

<p>"Besides the school at Shumlan, which is under the
care of the English Society for Promoting Female
Education in the East, the schools supported by England
are all in the hands of Elizabeth Bowen Thompson,
whose work is a very extensive one. Her schools
are at present twelve in number&mdash;five at villages in the
mountains&mdash;all (with the exception of one recently
opened at Ainzabatté, where an English young lady
is stationed) taught by natives who have been trained
by E. B. Thompson herself. Her work here began in
1860, when the fearful struggle between the Druses,
Maronites, and Mohammedans made so many widows
and orphans. These Elizabeth Thompson gathered
around her at Beirut, providing for and educating
them. Since then the field has gradually opened
before her, until she has now seven day-schools in
Beirut and its immediate neighborhood, and a normal
training-school of upward of sixty boarders. All of
these E. and S. J. have visited, many of them frequently."</p>

<p>"There are many daughters of Jews and Mohammedans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
among E. B. Thompson's scholars, and it is
very interesting to hear these little girls singing Christian
hymns with the others and repeating and listening
to passages predicting the coming of the Messiah alike
of the Jew and the Christian, and testifying of Jesus
as the Christ. E. and S. Jones had a very interesting
meeting with about forty of the native teachers and
others connected with these British schools. There
is a large girls' school, with an orphanage, under the
care of the Prussian deaconesses, similar to the one
we visited at Smyrna. Here Sybil Jones had an interesting
time with the sisters and the children. She
also visited the hospital, an establishment in beautiful
order, under the care of four of the sisterhood, where,
in a large house finely situated near the seashore, the
very poor are kindly nursed and cared for. A school
for Jewish children, conducted by missionaries sent
out by the Jews' society in Scotland, has lately been
established in Beirut. To this also the Friends paid
a visit, which was spoken of by teachers as very
helpful."</p>

<p>"We left the terraced sides of Lebanon on the last
day of the year, returning to the region of the palm,
orange, and prickly pear. The weather has this month
been very fine, though broken now and then by one of
the fierce, sudden winter storms with their rushing
rain and violent thunder and lightning. This wild
climate suits Sybil Jones remarkably well; she has
been better since returning to Beirut than she remembers
to have been before, and she enjoys the riding on
donkey-back. Eli Jones is better than when we first
landed in Syria, though the bracing air of the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
suits him better than this more relaxing temperature.
We have visited most of the missionaries.
Friends and their principles were almost unknown
here, but we have been most kindly received, and we
hope way has been made for others of our Society who
may come to this country. E. and S. Jones one day
visited the Beirut prison, into which they were admitted
without hesitation, and where they had the
pleasure of speaking to about forty poor creatures,
and of pointing them to Him who alone has power
to break our spiritual fetters."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Below we give extracts from a letter of Eli Jones to
the <cite>Friends' Review</cite>, written from Jaffa in Palestine:</p>

<p>"<em>2d mo. 17th, 1868.</em> E. C. Miller's health appearing
not quite equal to a long journey, and finding it not
possible to obtain more than three seats in the diligence
for Damascus on the 25th of 1st mo., it was
arranged that our young friend should 'stay by the
stuff' in Beirut while the other members of our party
went forward. Accordingly, at the early hour of two
o'clock <small>A. M.</small> we arose, breakfasted at half-past two,
and at three took conveyance for the station, and at
four precisely, with shawls, wraps, sandwiches, etc.,
were nicely packed in the coupée of the diligence."</p>

<p>"Our ride increased in interest as the young day
grew upon us, and by the time the sun had thrown
his full blaze of light athwart the western slope of
Lebanon the objects seen through the transparent
atmosphere of this land presented a most delightful
view. Our course was sufficiently tortuous to enable
us at times to look down upon Beirut and its surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
olive- and mulberry-orchards, stately palms,
and suburban villages, while beyond lay the Great Sea,
dotted here and there with the sail of many a merchant-ship,
and then again Sunnin, the highest western point
of Lebanon, snow-capped, stood majestically before us
clad in the changing hues of early morning."</p>

<p>"Reached the summit near ten, and after another
hour's ride of almost flying speed we looked down
upon the great valley of Buka'a or C&oelig;le-Syria,
bounded on the east by the Anti-Lebanon, clothed
in its snowy vesture, while far to our right Hermon,
the imperial monarch of Syrian mountains, was seen,
in its appearance fully justifying the appellation sometimes
applied to it&mdash;that of a silver breastplate."</p>

<p>"Just as the darkness of night shut out from our
view the fertile valley in which Damascus stood, our
last relay of animals was attached to the carriage, consisting
of six white horses; and fine specimens they
were. A little farther on our attention was arrested
by the sound of water on our right, and we were told
that it was the Barada River, the Abana of Scripture.
'Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,
better than all the waters of Israel?' The remainder
of our journey lay along the fertile valley of this ancient
river. It may, with the strictest propriety, be
termed a 'river of Damascus,' as it divides the city
into two parts and furnishes a liberal supply of water
to many of its inhabitants. We found comfortable
quarters at the Dimitris' hotel. The proprietor, a
Greek, speaks broken English and strives to make
the stay of his guests as agreeable as circumstances
will admit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>26th.</em> Sent our certificates to the missionaries for
their perusal. At 12 <small>M.</small> attended the prayer-meeting
of the few persons here who speak English. After
some singing and prayers, and a rather long theological
discussion, liberty was given to others to speak.
My dear Sybil availed herself of the opportunity to
express the feelings which lay with weight upon her
heart. This was done briefly, when she knelt in
earnest supplication on behalf of those present and
for the spread of the glorious gospel of God our
Saviour."</p>

<p>"The next day visited two of the schools under the
care of the missionaries; strove to encourage teachers
and pupils to act well their part. Then went to the
home of one of the Bible-women employed by E. B.
Thompson to go from house to house and teach such
women as desire to read the Bible."</p>

<p>"During our stay in the city we had frequently at
our morning readings of the Holy Scriptures the company
of the Bible-women and a few others, when our
hearts were made glad in the Lord."... "A few weeks
previous to the abdication of Louis Philippe the French
obtained a foothold in Algeria, after a lengthened struggle
of fifteen years or more, when Abdel-Kader, the
sultan of the Arabs and one of the most remarkable
men of his nation, was induced to surrender to the
power of the French, on the condition that he might
be allowed to retire to a Mohammedan country as a stipendiary
exile."... "He is a follower of Mohammed,
the founder of Islamism, and has shown his devotion
to the teachings of the Koran by a pilgrimage to
Mecca and Medina and by a lifelong adherence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the religion of his fathers. In 1860 thousands of
Christians in the Lebanon and in Damascus were
massacred in cold blood, instigated by the deadly
hate of the followers of the false Prophet, while hundreds
of others, men, women, and children, fled from
their pursuers and took refuge in the house and about
the premises of Abdel-Kader, who in the exercise of
the influence his position gives him, and from the
promptings of a kind heart, aided by his trusty followers,
shielded the helpless ones from the fury and
fanaticism of his co-religionists. Once the mob approached
his house and demanded with frantic yells
that the Christians within it should be delivered up
to them. He, accompanied by a strong body of his
followers, went out to confront the yelling crowd.
'Wretches!' he exclaimed, 'is this the way you honor
your prophet? May his curse be upon you! Shame on
you! shame! You will yet live to repent. You think
you may do as you like with the Christians, but the day
of retribution will come. The Franks will yet come and
turn your mosques into churches. Not a Christian
will I give up. <em>They are my brothers.</em>' The mob
withdrew."... "Abdel-Kader<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was at length enabled
to repose. He had rescued <em>fifteen thousand souls</em> belonging
to the Eastern churches from death, and worse
than death, by his fearless courage, his unwearied activity,
and his catholic-minded zeal. All the representatives
of the Christian powers then residing at
Damascus, without one single exception, had owed
their lives to him. Strange and unparalleled destiny!
An Arab had thrown his guardian ægis over the outraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
majesty of Europe. A descendant of the Prophet
had sheltered and protected the (professed) Spouse
of Christ. The day previous to our leaving Damascus
it seemed right to seek an interview with this noble
exile, and from a full heart, in my own name and in
behalf of my country and fellow-professors, thank him
for his kind and humane interposition, by which, under
Providence, so many fellow-beings were rescued from
an untimely and a cruel death. Passing up the street
upon which the house of the great chief stands, and
having Abou Ibrahim for a guide (who, by the way,
claims descent from Aaron), we observed Abdel-Kader
enter the gateway just before we reached it, where he
was standing when we arrived. Our guide having
addressed him, he kindly noticed A. L. Fox and myself,
and, cordially beckoning us to follow him, led us
to a simple reception-room, where, being seated, we
had an opportunity of saying what lay nearest to our
hearts, and enjoyed the pleasure of feeling that it was
kindly taken.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> While in Damascus we were in the
'street called Straight,' and visited the place indicated
by tradition as the house of Judas, where the blind
Saul of Tarsus lodged. We were shown the house
of Ananias, who was sent to cure the penitent of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
blindness, and the place in the wall where the disciples
took him by night and let him down in a basket. I
am not surprised that the Christian traveller feels some
misgivings as to the identity of these places when he
remembers that the evidence is mainly traditional.
There is, however, scarcely room to doubt that the
modern city occupies the site of the Damascus of
Scripture, and that the 'street called Straight' is the
identical one entered by Saul on that memorable day
that gave to the Gentile world a great apostle and to
the Christian Church one of its brightest luminaries."...
"The conversion of Paul was one of the most
momentous events of Scripture history. The fiery zeal
of Saul the persecutor was not extinguished&mdash;it was
sanctified."...</p>

<p>"Paul the missionary retained all his former
energy, boldness, and determination. In Damascus
he first preached 'Christ crucified;' then he went
into Arabia, then to Antioch, then through Asia Minor;
then he passed the Hellespont to Greece; and
then he went a prisoner to Rome, where he preached
the gospel though chained to a heathen soldier. The
apostle Paul occupies the first place among the New-Testament
worthies."... "Damascus is as old as history
itself. It has survived generations of cities that have
risen up in succession around it and have passed away.
While they all lie in ruins, Damascus retains the freshness
and vigor of youth."... "Outside of the eastern
gate of the city is a leper hospital, which to this day
is supposed by the inhabitants to occupy the site of
Naaman's house."... "There are in the city about thirty
thousand Christians, ten thousand Jews, one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
thousand Mohammedans, and of Protestant Christians
less than one hundred, all counted."</p>

<p>"On the 31st of the month we returned to Beirut
by diligence. During our stay of five days at Damascus
snow had fallen upon the mountains, but not
so as materially to retard our progress until we had
nearly reached the summit of Lebanon, when, being
furnished with a train of twelve animals and four outriders,
aided by a strong force of men, we proceeded
without much detention, arriving at our comfortable
quarters in good time."... "We anticipate leaving
in a few days for Jerusalem, should the weather permit
and the health of our party prove equal to the effort."...
"With love to all who love the truth as it is in
Jesus Christ,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Eli Jones.</span>"
</p>

<p>The following are extracts from a letter from Ellen
Clare Miller, written a few days after the return of Eli
Jones and A. L. Fox from Damascus:</p>

<p>"Eli Jones had a meeting at Beirut with some of the
young Syrian men of the town, which, though it was
a stormy night, was well attended and an interesting
time. On First day, the 9th, he had a very good
meeting in a suburb of the town at the house of one
of the principal men in the neighborhood."... "It
was a very interesting group, upward of one hundred
being present, some of the turbaned old men leaning
forward on their staves with their eyes fixed on Eli
Jones while, after the reading of the twelfth of Ecclesiastes
from the Arabic Bible, he addressed them
through the aid of our kind interpreter, Maalim Saleem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
seeking to bring all before him, old and young, to enter
into the service of Him whom he had from his youth
proved to be a good Master."</p>

<p>"On the 7th, Sybil Jones had a meeting with the
women connected with E. M. Thompson's school, at
which she spoke to them for about an hour of our
need of a Saviour."... "Many of these women have
learned to read, and they are very anxious that a school
should be opened for them where they may be taught
to read and sew by a native teacher."... "She visited
also some of the poor women at their own homes and
the Bible-women employed by E. M. Thompson, all
of whom seemed very ready to receive a visit from
one having their best interests at heart, and to listen
gladly to the word spoken."... "On Second day
evening a meeting was held by Eli and Sybil Jones
with the Arabic-speaking congregation at Beirut, who
readily responded to the invitation to meet them. Eli
Jones addressed them from the words, 'The law was
given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ.'"... "Sybil Jones followed, urging the necessity
of a heart-changing repentance."... "Sybil
Jones paid interesting visits to some of the harems at
Beirut, the first time we had been inside any of those
'gilded cages,' where the poor women, without the
resource of books, for they cannot read, or of work,
for they cannot sew, talk, sleep, dream, and smoke
life away, without the variety of walking out, for they
cannot be trusted abroad, and unable to look out into
the world except through a lattice. We went under
the care of E. M. Thompson, who obtains ready access."...
"We were driven as near the first house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as the carriage could be taken, but on alighting had to
ascend a steep, rough, narrow road, crossing a watercourse
here and there, then a branch road of steps,
then another torrent-path. The roads of ill-governed
Syria are deplorable indeed. At last we reached the
door of a large but unpretending-looking house, or
rather group of houses, for one opened out of another.
Here lived four families, related to each other, of the
first rank in Beirut, the grandmothers, the wives of the
house, girls, and children, in the flowing dress of the
East, sitting on the floor by the ashes of the braziers
or crouching on the divan, all but the youngest smoking
the unfailing nargileh with its long flexible tube.
They received us most cordially and affectionately, and
seated us by their sides, and through the medium of
one of E. M. Thompson's native teachers Sybil Jones
spoke to them, and also E. M. Thompson; but it was
very difficult to secure the attention of the company
for any length of time; they could not refrain from
laughing and chatting together. Poor creatures! some
of them looked almost devoid of intellect with the
long pipe-tubes in their mouths; others were very
pretty and seemed quite to appreciate the loss they
sustained by being uneducated. Some of the highest
Mohammedan families are very anxious that E. M.
Thompson should open a school for their elder girls,
where they would send them if no man was allowed
to look upon them. The desire for education is waking
up among them in a remarkable manner."...
"The ladies are all waited upon by dark, white-teethed
African female slaves in scanty clothing. Sherbet,
coffee, and sweetmeats were handed round, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
an insult to decline partaking, however many houses
we may have visited."... "Poor creatures! we could
not but desire that the true light might enter their
dwellings and shine into their hearts."</p>

<p>"We sailed from Beirut on the 12th, and came down
the coast in the night, passing in the darkness Sidon,
Tyre, Mount Carmel, and Cæsarea. After a rather
stormy passage we anchored next morning before
Jaffa, which rises up from the sea on a round hill, at
each side of which is a sandy bay."... "It is difficult
by description to give much idea of Jaffa with its
steep, narrow, dirty, and muddy lanes, and street-stairs
which climb up the hill among the old, dilapidated
houses crowded irregularly together."...
"Jaffa is very ancient, and, notwithstanding its extreme
dirtiness, an interesting place."... "The most
interesting place to visit in the town itself is the supposed&mdash;and,
indeed, well-authenticated&mdash;site of the
house of Simon the tanner, which stands by the sea-side,
rising up above the town-wall. The building
now standing is not supposed to be the very one in
which Peter lodged, but to have been built on the spot
where it stood. In the courtyard is a very ancient well
which helps to identify the place, and beside it is a
large stone trough of undoubted antiquity, probably
used to soak hides in, and partly covered by a large
flat stone like a currier's table."</p>

<p>"There is mission-work going on at Jaffa; P.
Metzler, a German educated at the Basle institution,
carries on a mill, with part of the profits of which he
supports a girls' day-school."... "Eli Jones with A.
L. Fox visited this school the other day, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
spoke to and examined the children, with whose intelligence
and answers he was much pleased."</p>

<p>"While the Friends were in Damascus I was present
at a native wedding, where the honored guests were
each furnished with a taper to hold; which had a great
interest as a remnant of the going forth with lamps to
meet the bridegroom alluded to in the parable of the
Ten Virgins. New light too has been thrown on the
expression 'heaping coals of fire on his head' by finding
that it is customary for the baker when he clears
his oven at night to give away the living embers to
those who will accept the kindness; and we have met
persons in the evening carrying these coals away on
their heads in large open braziers. It is remarkable
how little the customs of the people have changed
within the last two or three thousand years."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the above letter was written the Friends went
from Jaffa to Jerusalem, thence to Marseilles, having
held many meetings and interviews with teachers
and scholars in the schools, which are doing a great
work toward causing the light of day to dawn upon
unfortunate Syria. The following extracts from a
letter written by Eli Jones to the <cite>Friends' Review</cite> from
London will state clearly the reasons for their leaving
Palestine sooner than was expected: "We are again
in this great city, and comfortably quartered at the
house of our very kind friends Stafford and Hannah
S. Allen, where we are seeking rest and a renewal of
strength for further service for our good Master. For
more than two months past my dear Sybil has been
suffering from an attack of disease, leaving her at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
very weak; consequently, we were unable to accomplish
fully what we had in view in the Orient, leaving
several places in Palestine and in Egypt that we might
hasten the time of embarkation at Alexandria in order
to bear our invalid to a more favorable climate, as the
only thing likely to facilitate a cure. The voyage, with
the use of remedies prescribed by the physician on
shipboard, arrested the disorder for a time, and we
hoped the cure might prove permanent; but the journey
by train from Marseilles to Nismes proved too
much for the strength of our charge, and the disorder
rallied with fresh force and continued for some time,
but again yielded to skilful treatment and nursing by
our dear friend Lydia Majolier, whose kindness and
sympathy, with those of our much-loved friends in the
south of France, greatly cheered all our party. Near
noon of the 8th we took the train for Paris, and thence
to London by way of Boulogne, where we arrived after
a journey of thirty-three hours' continuance. Dear
S. bore the journey admirably, and we now entertain
the hope that a few days of quiet and rest may be of
great use, so that we may be able to proceed to Dublin
in season for the yearly meeting. Our long sojourn
in the East has not been without its trials. Sometimes
they seemed to us peculiar, and when we attempted to
look into the future it seemed doubtful if not dark.
Still, that kind Hand always stretched out to save has
gently led the way and shielded us from harm. Blessed
be the name of the Lord!"... "A. L. Fox left us
last evening for his home, where we now fancy him in
the society of wife and child, father and mother, brothers
and sisters, to whom he is tenderly attached and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
by whom he is greatly beloved. Dear E. C. Miller
intends to remain until Second or Third day of next
week before she leaves to join the home-circle, by
whom she will receive a warm welcome, but saddened
by the thought that one dear sister waits not on earth
to welcome the coming one, but in another and higher
scene of existence."</p>

<h3><em>SECOND VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND.</em></h3>


<p>The cause for which the two Friends came to England
before fully accomplishing their work in Syria was
the extreme feebleness of Sybil Jones. A change and
partial rest seemed imperative.</p>

<p>They soon began to labor in Cornwall, and they
were gratified to find "Quakerism still vital" in this
place where George Fox had sowed the seed exactly
two centuries before. Considerable time was spent
and much edifying work done at Falmouth, where
they were pleased to find so many Friends of high
literary and scientific attainments. The small meetings
of the neighboring villages received new life from
the earnest words and encouraging advice of the
travellers.</p>

<p>One of their letters describes the visit to a meeting
at Come-to-Good in the parish of Kea:</p>

<p>"Here is a meeting-house belonging to Friends
built more than two hundred years ago. It has a
most primitive appearance. The walls are of stone,
the abutments of the same material; the roof is
thatched with straw. It is in a rural and retired spot.
Only one Friend, and he of more than fourscore years,
resides in the neighborhood; but the many grassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
mounds that press about the door tell of generations
that have passed away. The meeting here was one
of great interest, and one to which we recur with unfeigned
pleasure. He who, we doubt not, has from
time to time met his servants here and at that altar of
'unhewn stones,' was now present to bless the waiting
ones. In this humble structure George Fox proclaimed
the good news with his wonted zeal and with all the
energy of a reformer."</p>

<p>In the same letter Eli Jones writes with great
feeling:</p>

<p>"A little farther on we reach the Land's End. Here
it stands, a bold promontory, with granite fingers pointing
toward the New World. As I climb these mighty
bulwarks that have successfully defied the power of
Old Ocean through every change of time, and look
out upon the unstable waters toward the setting sun,
what thoughts of kindred and country fill my breast!
Lord of life, great Spirit in the centre of all worlds,
bless thou them!"</p>

<p>For more than two months they dwelt at Plymouth,
during which time Sybil Jones gained strength rapidly,
although she was in a very critical condition. A
Friend from that city writes of their message there:
"I believe there are many in this part of the country
who will have reason to bless God in eternity for the
visit and gospel labors of Eli and Sybil Jones." Members
who had never before opened their lips in public
bore testimony that they desired to be on the Lord's
side.</p>

<p>The southern part of England was faithfully travelled
over, and the joys of a "life hid with Christ in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
God" proclaimed to the people, who everywhere received
the messengers and the message gladly. The
various meetings of Ireland were again attended. A
warm reception was given to the American workers,
who were already well known there from their previous
efforts, and an earnest and loving spirit seemed
to pervade many hearts. As this year (1868) was
closing, Eli Jones, with a heart full of love to God
for his immeasurable blessings, wrote to one of his
friends in the land which he so loved:</p>

<p>"As we turn to other households and to our country,
and to other countries and peoples, we see everywhere
evidences of the superintending care of Him
in whom we live and move and have our being. And
are we not reminded by divers tokens for good that
light is advancing? And may we not accept as true
the words of the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">'Upon the great dial-plate of ages</div>
<div class="line">The light advanced no more recedes'?</div>
</div></div>

<p>If this be so, let us bind on our armor, and as the newborn
year takes its place as the successor of those that
are past, and after it shall have done its full measure
of service in the long line of years shall give place to
others, who we hope may be blessed in their deed and
doing far beyond their progenitors.</p>

<p>"On the closing day of the last year I stood with
my fellow-travellers upon the western slope of Mount
Lebanon, and there reviewed the past and looked
prayerfully forward to the incoming year&mdash;a year
whose history will soon be complete. And what a
history! and what a work has been accomplished!&mdash;work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in which millions have been actors. The citizens
of the two great English-speaking nations, Great Britain
and the United States, have with unprecedented
unanimity at their late elections declared in favor of
religious liberty and of political equality. In Spain
multitudes seem only waiting to claim for themselves
and their countrymen these inalienable rights of all
men.</p>

<p>"Even in Turkey, where the teachings of the Koran
and the False Prophet have dominated so long, see
we not bright rays of light here and there amid the
darkness? I think we do. The Christian woman
with her firman from the sultan is diligently instituting
schools where the children of the Jew, the
Christian, and the Mohammedan are taught <em>not</em> the
<em>Koran</em>, but the <em>page</em> written by inspiration of God.</p>

<p>"If we turn to Madagascar, that far-off island of the
sea, we observe much with which to fill a large page
in the history of the year just closing. A queen has
reached the throne who looks approvingly upon the
workers among her pagan subjects, while thousands
press about those who tell the good news of salvation
by Jesus Christ, and hear them gladly; while Liberia,
India, China, and Japan can each furnish a page that
shall tell of light advancing and declare to the world
that 'God is love' and the 'Father of us all.'"</p>

<p>As the winter passed and Sybil Jones felt new
strength come from her partial rest in Great Britain,
while her husband continually carried on the work,
sometimes alone, sometimes with her help, they each
began to feel that there was more work to be done in
the East, though neither had spoken to the other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
regard to it. The 22d of 2d mo., their prospect having
become definite, with the full approval of English
Friends they once more embarked for Syria. They
spent nearly a week in the south of France, revisiting
their many friends there and encouraging them all to
continue on in their lives of service to the Master.
The meetings were very large, sometimes fully five
hundred being present, and they found their work
done sixteen years before had left a lasting impression.</p>

<p>After a delightful voyage over the blue waters of
the Mediterranean they came to Alexandria, where
there were many opportunities offered for spreading
the news of the way of life through the Saviour.
Here and at Cairo there were many who gladly listened
to the great truths which they were inspired to
preach. There, where Napoleon had told his soldiers
that forty centuries looked down upon them from the
heights of the Pyramids, these missionaries of love
labored to point their hearers to the Ancient of Days,
whose habitation is from eternity and which standeth
sure. The different mission-schools of Northern Egypt
were visited and helped in various ways.</p>

<p>Of this work Ellen Clare Miller, again their companion,
writes:</p>

<p>"The visit to Egypt was altogether of remarkable
interest, there being, especially among the native Christians
at Alexandria, an interesting and open field for
the spread of <em>spiritual Christianity</em>, and an earnest
longing in the minds of some after a closer <em>acquaintance
with the teaching of the Holy Spirit and His appearing
in the soul</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The 16th of 4th mo. they came to the end of their
journey, and camped outside the city of Jerusalem.
At once they began the work of visiting schools and
holding little meetings for all who wished to hear the
gospel, not only in Jerusalem, but in all the surrounding
villages. As these laborers rose before the groups
gathered round them on the very spots where the works
of our Master were wrought and where his words were
spoken, with the scenes of the greatest historic events
stretching out before them, a new power seemed to fill
them, and their souls were stirred for the salvation and
upbuilding of the people of this Holy Land. No class
of its inhabitants was neglected; even the lepers were
recipients of their message. Eli Jones visited the community
of these unfortunate beings, and tried to induce
them to come to the hospital prepared for them, telling
them also of Him who came into this world to deliver
us from even a worse disease than leprosy.</p>

<p>A letter from Eli Jones, written from Burkin, will
suffice to give the reader an idea of their travels and
a description of some of the places visited. Among
others he speaks of Ramallah, where the mission-school
was begun during their visit there. The letter
was written for the <cite>Friends' Review</cite>:</p>

<p>"Tented near this little town, the time of day something
past 'high noon' and the heat at 94° in the shade,
I take the time to jot down a few thoughts, or perhaps
I should say facts, for the perusal of my North American
correspondents. Since I last wrote thee we have
passed through portions of the ancient country of
Egypt, have looked with feelings of admiration and
wonder upon her pyramids and hieroglyphics, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
former standing out to-day in all their primeval
strength to tell of the <em>greatness</em>, or perhaps more
correctly of the <em>folly</em>, of their builders, and the latter
as we saw them upon the lasting rock apparently as
clearly defined as when fresh from the hand of the
recorder.</p>

<p>"The Nile, emphatically 'the river of Egypt,' still
flows onward to the sea, and in its season annually
waters the country, giving abundant fertility to the
soil, which if cultivated with skill and care would
make the adopted country of Joseph again the granary
of the world. We had a very pleasant sail upon this
wonderful river, embarking near the spot where floated
the ark of bulrushes containing the Hebrew child who
in the fulness of time became the leader and deliverer
of Israel from their long bondage in the land of the
Pharaohs. At the time of our visit the river was
spanned by a bridge of boats, thrown across by order
of the viceroy on the occasion of the marriage of some
members of his family: this circumstance gave us a
carriage-ride for several miles where otherwise we
must have had recourse to donkeys as a mode of
conveyance.</p>

<p>"A canal has been constructed extending from the
Nile near Cairo to Suez upon the Red Sea; these places
are also connected by the railroad; much of the way
this runs parallel to the canal. On our way to the
latter place we followed the iron horse for five or six
hours across the desert of sand which must needs be
passed, and which is enlivened only by the moving
sails upon the canal, the untiring steeds that bore us
on, and those tell-tale wires which, as with loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
arms, are embracing not only the seas and fertile lands,
but also the desert wilds. An highway (Isa. xi. 16) <em>is</em>
here, and shall not <em>this</em> desert yet blossom as a rose?
To our party the Red Sea was an object of much interest:
as we sailed out upon it we beheld at our right
the mountains through whose defiles the Lord's people
are supposed to have passed on their approach to the
water's edge, where, notwithstanding the hot pursuit
of their enemies, they were to hear the assuring language:
'Fear ye not; stand still and see the salvation
of the Lord, which He will show to you to-day; for
the Egyptians which ye have seen to-day, ye shall see
them again no more for ever;' and on our left was the
gently-sloping strand where they made their exit from
their watery way, and where we subsequently landed,
some of our party going a little way into the interior
to drink of the waters at the 'well of Moses,' which
remaineth unto this day. Let the God of Israel be
magnified, and let not His wonderful works be forgotten
by the children of men.</p>

<p>"During our brief stay in this part of Egypt we had
occasionally the opportunity of observing the progress
of the work upon the projected ship-canal across the
Isthmus of Suez. Of its ultimate completion and success
its projectors are very sanguine, and it is equally
clear that for the attainment of that end great engineering
skill has been displayed and a large expenditure
of money been made, and such a measure of unfaltering
perseverance and of unflagging determination to
overcome opposing difficulties brought into requisition
as have been manifested in few other enterprises undertaken
by man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the 6th of the 5th mo. the male members of our
party left for Jericho, travelling the very road, we may
suppose, upon which the man was journeying who 'fell
among thieves, who stripped him of his raiment and
wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.'
We halted near mid-day under the 'shadow of a great
rock,' and not far from the spot made ever memorable
and dear to the Christian by one of the most beautiful
and instructive parables of our blessed Lord&mdash;that of
the Good Samaritan.</p>

<p>"We found the way rough and in some places difficult,
yet there are in several places indications that in
the centuries past, perhaps in the days of Roman rule,
there was a highway here where the chariots of Jehu
and Jabin might have 'rolled harmlessly on.'</p>

<p>"Our tents we located near the modern Jericho,
which is supposed to occupy the site of Gilgal, the
camping-ground of the host commanded by Joshua,
and where he did 'pitch those twelve stones which
they took out of Jordan' in commemoration of their
miraculous passage through the waters. Almost immediately
upon reaching this place we put ourselves in
communication with the people. Found the entire
population Moslem, not one of whom can read, and
the evidences of moral degradation, especially among
some of the females, were remarkable. It should be
said, however, that when we spoke to them of matters
of the highest moment, and read to them from the
sacred volume, the majority listened with some approach
to respectful attention.</p>

<p>"In the evening the sheik and some twenty or more
of the men of the village responded to an invitation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
come to our tent: we read a portion of Scripture and
spoke to them of the beneficial effects of education
upon a people, and of our individual duties to God.
Our remarks were ably seconded by Prof. E. C. Mitchell
of Alton, Ill., who kindly united with us in striving
to stimulate the inhabitants of Jericho in the way
of mental and moral improvement. At the close of the
interview they assured us that we were the first persons
who had ever offered them a helping hand or spoken
to them of a better way than the one they were then
pursuing, and added that on the next evening they
would tell us whether they would accept our offer to
give them a school. At an early hour next morning
we were on our way to the Dead Sea, where we enjoyed
the luxury of a bath in its bitter and buoyant
waters; thence we passed on to the Jordan, to the place
where thousands of pilgrims come in commemoration
of the passage of the pilgrim band from Egypt under
the lead of Joshua, and of the baptism of the world's
great Deliverer by John, that the righteousness of the
law might be fulfilled. Here we lunched and duplicated
our bath in the Dead Sea: found the current of
the river strong and rapid, requiring much care to retain
one's position. The water is shoal, but of sufficient
depth in places to allow of baptism by immersion.</p>

<p>"On our return to Jericho the sheik kindly engaged
to convene some of the people in the town, where we
met fifty or sixty persons, and among the number
several females, who brought their long pipes and engaged
in smoking as they took their seats upon the
ground. Their faces and breasts were sadly tattooed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and on the whole they presented a spectacle not easily
matched short of the Western wilds of America. It
is, however, but justice to this country to say that
during my long stay here I have nowhere else seen its
like. The motley company were addressed by Prof.
Mitchell and others of our party, and we cherish the
hope that this labor will not be in vain in the Lord,
but that in due time fruit may appear. Soon after
reaching our tents several of the men called to say that
they wished a school for their children, and if we would
send a teacher they would gladly receive him. I hope
the means may be found to support a school at this
place. The good influence would extend rapidly to
the towns around.</p>

<p>"First day, 9th of the month, some of our party at
an early hour in the morning were at Bethany, the
town of Mary and Martha, where we collected upon
the top of a house such persons as we found at liberty,
and read the account of the raising to life of Lazarus, as
recorded by the evangelist, after which we trust Jesus
Christ was preached as the resurrection and the life.</p>

<p>"At half-past two <small>P. M.</small> of the 11th we left Jerusalem
on our journey northward, and soon after reached
the top of Mount Scopus, where on our right we enjoyed
a delightful view of the Dead Sea, the valley of
the Jordan near its mouth, and beyond the mountains
of Moab, and, turning to review the ground travelled
over, we had Jerusalem full in view; and perhaps from
no other point is the city seen to greater advantage
than from this, unless it be from Olivet. Tradition tells
us that Titus, the Roman invader, selected the top of
Scopus for his camping-ground, from which he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
easily observe much that was transpiring in and around
the doomed city.</p>

<p>"We now leave, probably for the last time, the city
dear to Jew and Greek, to Moslem and Christian, and
especially dear to us who have found an open door to
preach there Christ, and Him crucified.</p>

<p>"Some half hour on our way from Scopus we
turned aside a little to look upon the village of Anathoth
in the land of Benjamin, the home of Jeremiah
the son of Hilkiah. Resuming our course, we soon
reached 'Gibeah of Saul.' The place is indicated by
little more than a conical hill, which lay to our right.
On our left and more distant, capping a high eminence,
Mizpah was seen. Farther on Ramah was reached, the
home of the good Samuel, 'and Samuel judged Israel
all the days of his life. And he went from year to
year in circuits to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and
judged Israel in all those places. And his return was
to Ramah, for there was his house, and there he
judged Israel, and then he built an altar unto the
Lord.'</p>

<p>"Reaching Ramallah, some three hours from Jerusalem
we found our tent in readiness to receive us.
The town occupies an elevated position overlooking
the distant plain of Sharon. The air was cool and
bracing. 12th, visited a boys' school at Ramallah.
In the afternoon some of our party visited one at Jifneh,
the Gophna of Josephus. 13th, went to Bethel,
distant one and a half hours from our encampment.</p>

<p>"On approaching this place, so noted in Scripture
records, we observed the remains of a cistern 314 feet
by 217 feet, constructed of massive stones; the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
side is entire, the other sides are more or less ruined.
A portion of the enclosure is now used as a threshing-floor.
Here also is a fountain at which the cattle of
Abraham often drank in former days, and at which the
maidens of Sarah were wont to fill their pitchers as the
Arab maidens do still.</p>

<p>"The Bethel of to-day is a miserable Moslem village
with a low, uneducated population, amongst whom we
were unable to find more than one person who could
read. He is the one who calls the people to prayers;
to him we gave a tract and the Psalms of David in
Arabic.</p>

<p>"As we spoke to some of the inhabitants of our
great Father in heaven, and of our obligations to serve
Him, we were answered with little more than a vacant
stare and an expressed wish for backsheesh. What a
contrast between these followers of the False Prophet
and him who is called the 'father of the faithful,' who
here spread his tent and here rendered true homage to
the great <em>I Am!</em> and how unlike the patriarch Jacob,
who here, beneath heaven's broad canopy, slept, as
many an Arab now sleeps, on the bare ground with
a stone for his pillow! Here he dreamed of the ladder
which reached from earth to heaven, and on which the
angels were ascending and descending, and on awakening
was so impressed with the holiness and majesty of
Jehovah that he exclaimed,'How dreadful is this place!
This is none other than the house of God.' And here
the cheering promise was given him: 'In thee and all
thy <em>seed</em> shall all the families of the earth be blessed;
and behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all
places whither thou goest.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here Samuel, worthy of double honor, a prophet
of God and a judge in Israel, came on his yearly circuit
from Gilgal and Mizpah to hold his court and
render righteous judgment between brethren; and
thitherward turned the steps of Elijah and Elisha
while fulfilling their high commission as servants of
God.</p>

<p>"And here too came the youthful king Josiah, as
foretold by the prophet, and brake down the high-places
of Jeroboam, and burned down to the ground
the grove that grew up on the hill for the worship of
Astarte.</p>

<p>"On our return from Bethel we held a meeting at
Beeroth&mdash;now called Bireh&mdash;with a few Christians and
Moslems. Our interpreter read the fifth chapter of
Matthew, after which I drew their attention to the
teaching of the gospel, dwelling at some length upon
the words, 'Therefore whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.' They
listened with marked attention to all that was said.
On leaving we were told that a few years since a difficulty
arose from a very slight cause between two families
in the town, and, spreading to others, the spirit of
strife and revenge grew higher and higher till in their
murderous fury forty-four persons lost their lives, and
since then the spirit of revenge had shown itself in
other ways. Only the night before our meeting valuable
fig trees had been destroyed from the same
cause, and we were told that some of the parties concerned
were present and heard our words of exhortation.</p>

<p>"Beeroth was one of the four cities of the Gibeonites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
whose curious story the name will at once recall. It
is also thought to be the halting-place of Joseph and
Mary when they found that the child Jesus was not
among their friends and kinsfolk of the party. Ramallah,
twenty minutes from Beeroth, is professedly
a Christian village, occupying a commanding position
from which we get a fine view westward down the
mountain-sides of Benjamin and Ephraim, and over
the broad plain of Sharon to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"Toward evening we held a meeting at the Protestant
school-room in this town. The crowd of men,
women, and children became so dense that nearly
every one assumed a standing position, and all seemed
very eager to see the strangers, and, as I thought, very
curious to hear a woman address a public assembly.
My S. J., taking her stand upon a bed in a corner of
the room, spoke earnestly and at considerable length
upon the way of life and salvation, to which many
listened with fixed attention.</p>

<p>"<em>14th.</em> At the request of S. J., a meeting was appointed
for females; many responded, and a satisfactory
meeting was held. Meantime, the male members
of our party called at the Latin convent. Found the
monk at its head with a school of eight or ten boys,
which he summarily dismissed upon our entering,
assigning as a reason that it was time for them to
leave, though it was but ten o'clock in the morning.
From the answers which he gave to our numerous
inquiries we were induced to think that although he
and his associates may not do much to enlighten the
people around them, yet that as an individual he is
really loyal to the Church of which he is a member,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and that he considers salvation very unlikely, if not
impossible, apart from conformity to its rules and its
traditional observances.</p>

<p>"In the evening a meeting was held with males
only, in which they were exhorted to prepare to
meet their God in peace by repentance toward Him
and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and also to a
faithful performance of their several duties as husbands,
fathers, and brothers, that so the position of
women may be elevated in this land and her children
prepared for a useful career among men.</p>

<p>"I am closing this sheet at Beirut, the 12th of 6th
mo.; and as the mail closes very soon, I have only
time to add that our party are in good health and
look to turning their faces homeward in a few days.</p>

<p class="center">
"Thy loving and sincere friend,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Eli Jones.</span>"
</p>

<p>It will not be possible to give the further details of
the faithful efforts of this little party to promote the
highest earthly and eternal welfare of the inhabitants
of this once highly favored land. They visited all the
spots made sacred by the steps of Him whom they
followed, but they went not to satisfy their desire
of beholding: they bore tidings of joy to the sorrowful.
They pursued their journey as far north as
Beirut, preaching in every city and village, and leaving
in many places money behind them for the advancement
of education. Wholly devoted as they
were to the service of the Lord, with great love for
all the human souls where they went, and power being
given them to tell the story of a mighty Deliverer, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
fruit of work must have been very abundant. We do
not need to count those converted in such work for
the Lord, and even if we could we should still be
unable to estimate the value of the seed thrown broadcast
over the land, which may long lie dormant and
finally bud into new grain.</p>

<p>On the 22d of 6th mo. Eli and Sybil Jones, with
their companions, E. C. Miller, Joseph Pim, Richard
Allen, and T. C. Wakefield, sailed from Beirut for the
Occident, stopping on their way at Athens, Marseilles,
and Geneva, and reaching London the 10th of 7th mo.
Soon after their arrival in England the two American
Friends embarked for their home. Sybil Jones's work
in the Eastern continent was now complete, and she had
the great satisfaction of feeling that she had in every
particular obeyed the call of Him whom she served.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>After the return from the East a few more days
were left for Sybil Jones to tell the same story to men
and women nearer her own home. Her frail body had
carried her to many shores, and had not given way
until she was once more among lifelong friends.</p>

<p>She had presented Christianity to Mohammedan
women "from the standard of equality of sex in social
life, religion, and the ministry of the word." She had
entered the "gilded cages" of Eastern harems and
"borne the gospel with a sister's love to those unhappy
inmates&mdash;glad tidings which they had never heard
until proclaimed by her lips." With no relaxation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of fervor, with no diminution of power, she continued
to tell those not living in communion with God that
"to be carnally-minded is death," and with the earnestness
of one saving drowning men from the depths of
the sea she stretched forth her hands and raised her
touching voice to save them from a still worse death,
the wages of their sins. The series of general meetings
which Friends had just begun to hold gave her an
opportunity to come before large audiences of all denominations,
of the different classes. Many who came
were unconverted; many more were in a dangerously
lukewarm state; others needed strength and comfort.
To one and all she proclaimed the great truth that
whosoever liveth unto himself dieth, but "whoso hath
the Son hath life;" and to the hearts where sorrow and
discouragement and doubt dwelt she spoke of a joy
for the world, an encouragement "to press toward the
mark for the prize," a faith and belief that overcome.
Over those long Maine hills, in the balmy air of
autumn, fresh from the yellow grain and mellow fruit,
or creaking through the snowdrifts of mid-winter, she
and her husband, both with the same thought uppermost,
rode to sit down on the high seats of those broad-based,
low-eaved Friends' meeting-houses, and to rise
again and speak messages of healing inspired by the
great Physician. She loved to live, for every day gave
her one more chance to call to the unhappy to be made
happy. She loved to live, because she enjoyed the
beautiful things which God brought daily before her
eyes in His book written with His own hand. It was,
too, a joy to her to be with her family, to be a mother
to her dear children, a wife to her wedded fellow-laborer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and a friend to the many who loved her; but while she
loved life she knew enough of our God to be assured
that when her "bark sank it would be but to another
sea," and that what we call death is but going from a
chrysalis life to a fulness of knowledge and a fulness
of life. No change that merely freed her of what
could die and left her wholly immortal could be terrible
to her, and so she had never, in all the days of extreme
sickness which she had passed, had other thought than
that she was being kept from work. To the very last
she pleaded with her wonted earnestness: "I beseech
you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God," and
she loved to quote the hymn which expressed the
aspiration of her soul:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Oh, if <em>one soul</em> I've pleaded with</div>
<div class="line indent2">Meets me at God's right hand,</div>
<div class="line">My heaven will be two heavens</div>
<div class="line indent2">In Immanuel's Land."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The thought has often been expressed that as the
spiritual life of a man or woman grows, develops, and
gains complete mastery, the body gradually takes on a
new and deeper beauty; a something which had not
formerly existed shines out and hallows the face, and
somewhat as the setting sun puts over the clouds a
glory which throughout all the long sunshiny day had
not been seen, so a brighter gleam comes out from a
ripened soul, and it becomes more than ever evident
that the inhabitant of the clay house had come "trailing
clouds of glory from God who is its home." This
was decidedly true with her. The tall, erect, queenly
person, the large head, high forehead, deep hazel eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the smile which so often played upon the lines of her
countenance,&mdash;all took a new meaning as the "light
which never was on sea or land" shone through them,
proving that her "citizenship was in heaven" and that
she indeed was "a fellow-citizen of the saints." We
know not what is beyond our ken for such as she, but
we believe that He who created such a wondrous home
for the mortal part has otherwhere a proportionally
magnificent domain for that which dieth not. A few
hours before she died she exclaimed in the words
of the martyr Rutherford:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Oh, well it is for ever,</div>
<div class="line indent2">Oh, well for evermore,</div>
<div class="line">My nest hung in no forest</div>
<div class="line indent2">Of all this death-doomed shore."</div>
</div></div>

<p>And on the afternoon of the 4th day of 12th month,
1873, she left the life of toil and struggle for the life of
reward.</p>

<p>Ellen Congdon of Providence wrote in fitting words:
"I have taken comfort in the midst of this great bereavement
to the Church militant in thinking of the
rejoicing and the welcome as her ransomed spirit took
its place among the redeemed of all generations. Yet,
far, far beyond even this must have been the holy
rapture with which she realized the fulfilment of that
gracious promise: 'Thine eyes shall behold the King
in His beauty, and thou shalt see the land that is very
far off.'"</p>

<p>The governor of the State showed his appreciation
of the departed one in the following extract from a
letter to her son Richard: "Had it been possible I
should have been present at the funeral services. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
remember your mother from my boyhood, and received
the news of her death with profound sorrow.
She exemplified the true Christian character in a degree
rarely equalled in this life; indeed, she has always
appeared to me more in the heavenly than the earthly.
In her death the Christian religion has lost one of its
brightest ornaments and noblest defenders. Yours is
the priceless consolation which the gospel and the remembrance
of a life so full of noble deeds afford. Any
words of mine would be poor and weak, but I cannot
forbear conveying to you and your much-esteemed
father, whom I have known and honored for many
years, my heartiest sympathy. Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Sidney Perham.</span>"
</p>

<p>Her funeral, held in the Friends' meeting-house, was
attended by a large company of friends, relatives, and
neighbors. The citizens of the town came in large
numbers to look for the last time on the one whom
they loved and reverenced. Harriet Jones, Samuel
Taylor, Sarah Tobey, and others spoke feelingly.
"All hearts were moved," says one who was present,
"as our venerable and highly esteemed friend Eli
Jones arose, controlling the feelings of a heart filled
with sorrow, and revealed what had heretofore been
kept by him&mdash;viz. the manifestation of divine power
that had attended her mission while they travelled in
foreign lands; also the blessing following her labors
during the past few months in attending some one
hundred and forty meetings, principally in her own
State, in which she appeared like a reaper gathering
the harvest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>It is never well for us to speak over-highly of any
one or of the service of any one. Power speaks for
itself. We spend no breath of praise on the might of
Niagara or the majesty of Mont Blanc. God has made
them so that they tell us themselves continually of
their grandeur. In like manner, the character and
work of his human creatures tell to their generation
and the following ones their strength and worth without
the aid of man's voice.</p>

<p>What Sybil Jones did and said has been felt and has
made its impression in the world, and no word which
now might be spoken could add to what she really
accomplished. For sixty-five years she went about
doing what she seemed to have been sent to do. She
was under no shackles of creed, but she had a faith
which anchored her; she built on a foundation which
had already been laid, and she wasted none of her
energy seeking answers to unnecessary questions.
Her whole heart was in her work, and nothing held
her back in her desire to go on herself to perfection
and to call others thereto. The power of her spiritual
discernment was shown in numerous cases where she
told minutely the state and feeling of some before
her, and she felt out wonderfully the proper course
for her to take. She seemed to grow stronger as
she engaged in a new field of work, and not unusually
she left her bed of sickness to undertake an arduous
journey for an absence of one or two years. She
went from Ireland to Norway on a couch, and there
endured remarkable hardships, but grew stronger as
she worked, and was almost daily before the people
for the next six months. She had a striking influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
over unprincipled and dangerous men, and she never
hesitated to go alone among the greatest outcasts.
The swearing sailors on the ship for Liberia grew
more gentle as they knew her, and she walked fearlessly
into the cell of one of the worst prisoners in
the United States: he was touched to tears and
blessed the day that brought her to him.</p>

<p>As a minister she was especially gifted in exhortation
and prayer, but she knew the Bible, and she knew
experimentally the meaning of its promises and commandments.
Her use of language was remarkable:
every thought she wished to express was clothed
richly, every truth was made clear to her hearers,
and no words were wasted. God gave her a voice,
not like Milton's, "whose sound was like the sea,"
but soft as the wind in the trees and strong to reach
the farthest seats. There was a music in it which
charmed, and a reserved power and volume which she
could use when the occasion called for it.</p>

<p>The good people in the south of France still say,
"She seemed to us like an angel;" which shows how
her earnest tones and kind deeds impressed these
simple-hearted people, who saw too few that loved
to feed the sheep and the lambs. Her active work
in the ministry began with her first visit to the provinces.
Between that time and her death she went as
a herald through her own land; to Liberia, to England,
Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland,
and France; to Scotland, Greece, Egypt, and the Holy
Land. Few women, if any, before her had been called
to so many and so widely separated peoples. By every
race and nation she was kindly received, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
enabled to speak to them boldly and with such power
that the lives of those who heard her were noticeably
changed. Standing often where woman never stood
before to speak, she lovingly urged the multitudes of
ignorant, unsaved hearers to come to the Lord for
teaching and salvation. The effect of her live words
on those who had heard only formal preaching can
hardly be described. When in her most earnest attitude,
she was calm in her pleading, avoiding all that
was sensational and speaking simply to reach the heart.
There has never been a more striking instance of reliance
on the divine Voice in the soul. There were
numerous occasions in her life when not only all her
friends, but skilful physicians, concurred in advising
her to rest her exhausted body when she felt work
immediately before her. In every case she replied,
"I have this work to do now; I cannot take another
course;" and in no case was she mistaken. Once at
least she went from her own home to the train on a
couch, but the results of the visit could leave no one
in doubt from whence came the command for her to
go forth.</p>

<p>Like Madame Guyon, it was her unceasing desire to
bring her individual will into full harmony with the
will of God, and like her she sought earnestly to distinguish
minutely between her own impulses and the
promptings of the Spirit of God; not unlike Madame
Guyon, she knew her place to be where she could
work actively among men for their enlightenment. No
small part of her work was with soldiers and prisoners.
Following the example of Elizabeth Fry, she went
where sin had made the deepest stains. Not only did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
inmates of wards and cells become gentler as she
talked to them, but they regarded this world and the
next from a different standpoint when she had finished
speaking to them of the one hope which she had
come to bring them.</p>

<p>As she understood the New Testament, and as she
interpreted the whisperings within her, it seemed clear
that the disciple of Christ must devote himself or herself
to uplifting a larger or smaller portion of the
human race, the radius of influence depending on the
number of talents received&mdash;that each servant's work
might be different, but each one must get into an attitude
to <em>find</em> his task, and then all must work to produce
fruit for the same harvest-home.</p>

<p>The following is quoted from Harriet Beecher Stowe
in her <cite>Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands</cite>:</p>

<p>"C. had been with Joseph Sturge during the afternoon
to a meeting of the Friends, and heard a discourse
from Sybil Jones, one of the most popular of
their female preachers. Sybil Jones is a native of
Brunswick, Maine. She and her husband, being both
preachers, have travelled extensively in the prosecution
of various philanthropic and religious enterprises.</p>

<p>"In the evening Joseph Sturge said that she had expressed
a desire to see me. Accordingly, I went with him
to call upon her, and found her in the family of two aged
Friends, surrounded by a circle of the same denomination.
She is a woman of great delicacy of appearance,
betokening very frail health. I am told that she is
most of her time in a state of extreme suffering from
neuralgic complaints. There was a mingled expression
of enthusiasm and tenderness in her face which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
very interesting. She had had, according to the language
of her sect, a concern on her mind for me. To
my mind there is something peculiarly interesting
about the primitive simplicity and frankness with
which the members of this body express themselves.
She desired to caution me against the temptations of
too much flattery and applause, and against the worldliness
which might beset me in London. Her manner
of addressing me was like that of one who is commissioned
with a message which must be spoken with
plainness and sincerity. After this the whole circle
knelt, and she offered prayer. I was somewhat painfully
impressed with her evident fragility of body compared
with the enthusiastic workings of her mind. In
the course of the conversation she inquired if I was
going to Ireland. I told her yes, that was my intention.
She begged that I would visit the western
coast, adding, with great feeling, '<em>It was the miseries
which I saw there which have brought my health to the
state it is in.</em>'</p>

<p>"She had travelled extensively in the Southern
States, and had in private conversation been able very
fully to bear witness against slavery, and had never
been heard with unkindness. The whole incident afforded
me matter for reflection. The calling of women
to distinct religious vocations, it appears to me, was a
part of primitive Christianity; has been one of the
most efficient elements of power in the Romish Church;
obtained among the Methodists in England; and has
in all these cases been productive of great good. The
deaconesses whom the apostle mentioned with honor
in his epistle, Madame Guyon in the Romish Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Mrs. Fletcher, Elizabeth Fry, are instances to show
how much may be done for mankind by women <em>who
feel themselves impelled to a special religious vocation</em>.
The example of the Quakers is a sufficient proof that
acting upon this idea does not produce discord and
domestic disorder. No people are more remarkable
for quietness and propriety of deportment and for
household order and domestic excellence. By the
admission of this liberty the world is now and then
gifted with a woman like Elizabeth Fry, while the
family state loses none of its security and sacredness.
No one in our day charges the ladies of the Quaker
sect with boldness or indecorum, and they have demonstrated
that even public teaching, when performed
under the influence of an overpowering devotional
spirit, does not interfere with feminine propriety and
modesty. The fact is, that the number of women to
whom this vocation is given will always be comparatively
few: they are, and generally will be, the exceptions,
and the majority of the religious world, ancient
and modern, has decided that these exceptions are to
be treated with reverence."</p>

<p>John G. Whittier writes in his poem, the "Meeting:"</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>In conclusion, it will be proper to insert the following
brief sketch from one who knew her most intimately:</p>

<p>"Naturally extremely timid, when duty called her
fearlessness was wonderful. With nerves so sensitive
that the closing of a door would often startle her, in
God's service she looked calmly upon death and
danger in every form. Though much and acceptably
before the public, the truly feminine graces ever
stood forth prominently in her character. With her
own hands she often performed the duties of her
household, always entertaining much company, not
only from neighboring States, but from foreign lands;
guided to manhood and womanhood five children,
and soothed the last hours of many of her kindred.
With a bodily frame very much enfeebled by a complication
of diseases, she was constantly being reminded
of the uncertainty of her life, and ever lived
nearer to heaven than earth. Her mind was frequently
absent, and when called back it was found to have
wandered after some poor soul who had not yet received
the 'good news' which her life was consecrated
to publish. So little did she notice the landmarks
of this earthly journey that the writer of this
can affirm that scenes and places through which she
had passed a score of times were ever new and unfamiliar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to her absent gaze. When engaged in missionary
labors her faith that God would care for her
and hers was deep and constant. God's commands
were her sole guide of her life; when these
reached her she prepared to obey them without a
thought of the means. Her invariable remark was,
'I am the King's daughter: the gold and silver are
mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.' Before her
faith-inspired energy every difficulty vanished. She
left the aged and enfeebled mother or the babe at her
breast, committing them to the Master in child-like
trust. Through all she clung with the relentless grasp
of an abiding faith to the promises of her prayer-answering
God, and if ever a cloud came over her way
she remained on her knees until she saw its 'silver
lining.' It may, then, with truth be said of this woman
that her leading aim on earth was the winning of souls
to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the staff on which she
leaned the faith of Abraham, and prayer her 'vital
breath.'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are a few extracts from some of the letters
written by Sybil Jones very near the end of her life
which will be read with interest, since they set forth
the progress of the active religious work which Friends
in New England were just beginning at that time, and
also give expression to her faith in regard to such work
with reference to the necessity of an abiding defence
against everything which might hinder permanent
blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>She writes, 1st mo. 31, 1870, to her dear friend
S. T.:</p>

<p>"I agree with thee that a revival is greatly needed,
and that one is really begun and is prospering is cause
for grateful songs of thanksgiving and praise to Him
who causeth the outgoings of this brighter dawning to
rejoice. Let our united prayers go up to the 'throne
of God and the Lamb' that upon all the glory there
may be a defence. That this glorious visitation will
have its temptations we must know, for whenever the
Spirit of Christ begins to work for the salvation of
souls through the blood of the Lamb, Satan presents
himself to defeat by various stratagems, if possible, the
blessed work. My faith is, however, that the Most
High will protect his own children and his own work,
and cause it to prosper and spread abundantly. The
bow of promises spans the whole. There is a great
awakening in these parts; many old sinners are turning
to the Lord and speaking of His great love. Young
people too are bringing their early offerings to Him,
for which my heart rejoices greatly."</p>

<p><em>9th, 22d, 1873.</em> She writes from Oak Grove Seminary
in Maine: "My dearest S., I am still here, and have
been so ill I thought I might not see my dear sister
any more below or reach my dear little home, my
earthly tent; but my gracious Lord has led me up
from 'the crossing' again thus far, and I rejoice in
His will, whatever it may be. I have reached this
place on my way home, and hope to be able to go in
a few days if the Lord will.</p>

<p>"Thou may have heard of the wonderful outpouring
of the Holy Spirit at the general meeting in Winthrop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
I attended only one session, but I never was
more happy. Peace and glory reigned around while
poor sinners were coming to Jesus. The gospel full
and free and in apostolic simplicity was preached, and
great was the company of those who heard it and
were moved by its power through the Spirit.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell thee much now. I was laid aside
with <em>my Beloved</em>, and oh the richness and fulness of
His love to His weak child! I seemed to enjoy all
that was passing in that wonderful tent where three
thousand were present on First day. Many from city
and country said they never heard such a powerful
gospel message before. People are calling in every
direction for the Friends to come and hold meetings.
Let us be instant in prayer, ready to do our part in
the vineyard of the Lord."</p>

<p><em>4th mo. 20, 1873.</em> Not many months before her own
departure she writes of her mother's death in a letter to
S. T., headed "Travellers' Home:" "I have been watching
a sweet loving mother to the banks of the stream
where all of my own family save my lonely self had
passed before. I felt sure she would see the beautiful
summer-time on earth no more; of this she too was
aware, and made all needful arrangements for the event
to her desirable. She appeared more and more angelic
in expression and features as the time drew near to
leave us. Her prayers and exhortations at the family
altar were offered in great self-abasement, but wonderfully
beautiful and fervent. The last night was a glorious
time to her: though in great suffering, her face
appeared so youthful and fair, beaming with such
serenity, that all could bear witness to her victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
through the blood of the Lamb. Her last sentence
only will I mention. Near the close she exclaimed
with both cold hands uplifted: 'Glory! glory! glory!
I see the angels!' after this only the word 'glory,'
faintly uttered could be heard."</p>

<p>The last public religious service of this dear Friend
was at Windham, Maine, during a general meeting held
there. Of this last visit a Friend who was present
writes:</p>

<p>"First day evening, 11th mo. 3d, 1873, to a crowded
house she preached for half an hour from the text, 'If
I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
Follow thou me.' As the meeting was to close, she
stood and most impressively repeated a farewell hymn,
dwelling upon the lines, 'Farewell, poor sinner.' Pausing,
she three times repeated these lines. None of us
ever listened to a voice of such melody: it is indescribable&mdash;so
solemn the message, so full of entreaty
the tone.</p>

<p>"Her husband attended meeting at Deering on Fourth
day following, but she remained in the house. Her messages
to individuals in our neighborhood are treasured
as coming from one so near the border as to be freighted
with heavenly sanctity.</p>

<p>"From report of quarterly meeting committee I quote:
'We cannot close this report and do justice to appointment
and the precious memory of Sybil Jones (since
gone to the eternal rest) without referring to her attendance
at the general meeting in company with her husband.
It was a great blessing to us to be recipients of
this closing labor of her peculiarly devoted life. Many
can bear witness to the heavenly expression of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
countenance, her calmness, earnestness, yet tenderness
of spirit, and the unusual unction which attended her
ministrations as she pleaded <em>with</em> and <em>for</em> the erring and
labored to restore the waste places of our Zion."</p>

</div></div>


<p>It need not be told, and it could not, how the loss
of his wife affected Eli Jones, already venerable with
age. Those only who have borne a like sorrow
know the depth of the wound. The strength of his
character and the weight of his love were never shown
more fully than in the first years of his widowed life.
War had taken his first-born, his sons were at their
work in the world, his eldest daughter was married,
and the youngest daughter alone was still with him.
Though sixty-six years of age, he was yet strong, and
knew that much more work was before him if his life
should be spared. There was no time given him to
rest. Not his to question the ways of Providence, but
to work while the day lasted. He could turn his face
to no field where he was not reminded of her who had
diligently stood by his side, and his loneliness gave a
new power to his words. As Tennyson of his departed
friend, he could say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Far off thou art, but ever nigh;</div>
<div class="line indent2">I have thee still, and I rejoice;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
<div class="line indent2">I prosper circled by thy voice;</div>
<div class="line">I shall not lose thee though I die."</div>
</div></div>

<p>For the first few years after the separation he was
generally engaged near home. The duties of farm-work
filled up the spaces between the monthly, quarterly,
and general meetings which he attended. The
little black horse that all his townsmen knew so well
grew very familiar with the winding roads to Vassalboro',
Brooks, St. Albans, Manchester, and other near-lying
towns. "Uncle Eli has come" made all who had
gathered at the meeting-house rejoice, and, whether
the subject was peace, temperance, or salvation, he
spoke strong words to stir the listeners.</p>

<p>During all his life he has loved to till the soil; trees
seem to be near friends of his. Lowell is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line indent4">"Midway to believe</div>
<div class="line">A tree among his far progenitors,</div>
<div class="line">Such sympathy is his with all the race."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Eli Jones hardly claims relationship with the birches,
but they are his close friends, and he has had many
happy hours working among his trees. Perhaps he
never was a farmer such as the editors of agricultural
journals would extol, and it is certain that the hilly
fields, with here and there a ledge of rock, in his farm
at Dirigo would never have allowed him to accumulate
wealth, even if his work had been exclusively there;
but he felt the nobility of the calling. There was no
yoke of bondage to the soil over him, and he got
nearer Nature's heart as he planted, as he dug, and as
he harvested. Those who exhort to a higher spiritual
life can never know too much of the mysteries of animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and plant life; they can never be too conversant with
the trials and pains which daily toil brings to those to
whom they preach. Paul could touch hearts when he
appealed to tentmakers; Peter had an unwonted power
when fishermen were before him; and he who holds up
hands hardened by hoe and spade will gladly be heard
by those who have left the oxen in the furrow to listen
to the gospel. Slavery to work narrows the mind, as
any slavery does, but diligence in some business will
never lessen the depth of a true Christian or weaken
the influence of an endowed minister. Eli Jones has
always been loved by all the animals in his house and
barn, for there is true philosophy in the line, "For
Mary loved the lamb, you know." His sheep would
come from all corners of the pasture when he came
to their feeding-place, and often he took his cane and
walked out to give them salt and to learn their ways.
Sheep that are loved grow best, and his flock was proof
of it. After work he sat under one of the large maples
near the house, and while resting, if alone, carefully
studied the higher and lower laws of the birds over his
head and the insects at his feet. I do not believe he
ever knowingly stepped on a worm or beetle, and no
life of any kind was ever willingly destroyed by him.
He could mow on Fifth day until time for meeting, and
then hay-making, and the possibility of showers were
out of the realm of his thought, for there was a higher
work which needed an undivided mind.</p>

<p>Nothing inanimate has interested him more than fossils
and geological specimens. He made a large collection
of them, and whenever an unusual stone showed
itself under his hoe, it was examined. The perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of the minute shells, and consequently of the long-dead
animals that once dwelt in them, deeply impressed
him. The variety of trees and flowers which
were growing in his garden and grounds astonished
those who were acquainted only with the birches,
beeches, maples, pines, hemlocks, the ordinary growth
of the Maine woods; but he was delighted to see
trees of other climes flourish in the hard Northern
soil of his fields. His apples, pears, and grapes have
reached the heart of many a boy who has wondered
why his father has always lived contented with "Bitter
Sweets" when "Early Harvests" are so good and easy
to raise; and an invitation to spend a day in this garden
of the Hesperides was not soon to be forgotten; and
in fact it was a day of growth in the boy's better
nature.</p>

<p>There was something still more gratifying than such
an invitation: it was to sit in the "South Meeting-house"
when "little David" or Samuel or Joseph was
the text. Others might instruct the heads of the
meeting, but little eyes, sometimes heavy with sleep,
opened and grew larger as the shepherd on the hills
of Bethlehem had his arm nerved by the strength of
the Lord or as Samuel cried, "Speak, Lord, for thy
servant heareth." He drew pictures of those far-off
scenes until a panorama seemed unrolled and young
and old saw the mighty characters of the early dispensation
working before them; and it was not long before
a new light came over those same hills and new songs
filled the air: "Rejoice, for unto you is born, this day,
in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the
Lord."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>During these days of farm-life Eli was often chosen
to fill the different town offices. As "supervisor of
schools" he used to hear the geography lessons and
make the map look so large and real that the scholars
felt that it in fact represented solid earth. Then he
was sure to ask the whole school some question
which would start a train of new thoughts, and he
was not likely to leave the school-house without
setting forth in a novel way the need of learning
how to spell and the mistake of trying greater fields
of work before this one was conquered.</p>

<p>It was in the "town-meeting&mdash;the old "New England
town-meeting"&mdash;that he showed his peculiar tact
and strength. The men of the town were there to
settle the knotty question of "new roads," "improved
schools," "care of the poor," and a long list of similar
points. It is always a question with boys "how
they make Presidents," and it is no less so how they
make "selectmen and supervisors;" and on these great
days young statesmen were being taught there. The
speakers for and against the different articles in the
"warrant," stood up on benches and spoke. A moderator
was appointed who kept order and decided
difficult points. The younger, non-voters, were surprised
to hear such eloquence and to see such weighty
matters handled by men whom they knew only as
great woodcutters or haymakers; but it really seemed
to them that another Demosthenes must be in the
midst of them when Eli Jones began to argue down
the weak schemes and prop up the wise plans for
public improvement. At least one listener remembers
how one important point was settled. The question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had been discussed whether the town should pay
up its "war debt" and by taking on itself a double
tax for one year throw off the burden of a heavy tax
each year to pay interest-money. It had been decided
affirmatively, but after the meeting was over and the
citizens had gone home and talked with their wives,
it began to seem to many that too great a step had
been taken, and a call was issued for a new meeting
to rescind the vote. There was much feeling, and the
signs of a strongly divided camp were evident. The
stir indicated that the question was momentous. A
plain but strong argument was given to rescind the
vote on the ground that it would be wiser to divide
the amount and take a number of years to pay it than
to impoverish the poor farmers by forcing such a tax
upon them at one time. It may have been because
the writer was very young and impressible, but the
reply seemed to him masterly and worthy of a much
greater occasion. Not a word was lost; the answer
was brief, and its burden was that it was time to be
free from the stigma of this debt, which either those
present or their children must pay, and that if every
citizen would play the man and do his duty now the
debt would be blotted out, and easily. A vote was
taken, and by a large majority it was agreed to leave
the next generation free from debt by paying it at
once; which was done.</p>

<p>The work of a man for the bettering of his own
town is not unimportant, though it may seem so when
we consider the greater fields of usefulness. He who
has roused his neighbors and helped them find a better
way of educating their sons and daughters has accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
a work of immense importance. If all the
towns and villages were taken care of, the State would
soon rest on a sure foundation, and he is a skilful
physician who labors to <em>heal</em> the troubles in the towns
which supply <em>life</em> to the cities. Eli Jones has always
said that the great aim must ever be to get the individual
home in a proper condition. It is not possible
to show how much he quietly did in the years he spent
at Dirigo, but certainly it was time well used, and we
need not lament that he was "hemmed in" by county
lines. What he did is poorly and briefly recorded
here, but it is written imperishably somewhere, not
infrequently on the impressible hearts of men.</p>

<h3><em>LATER VISITS TO THE EAST.</em></h3>


<p>The later visits of Eli Jones to Palestine and their
object have already been spoken of. With an accurate
knowledge of the land and its customs, as well as of
the needs of its people, he was especially adapted to
taking a prominent part in directing the work of education
there. He has always had a faculty for raising
funds, and, having been especially successful in gathering
money for building and necessary expenses, the
time seemed to have come for opening a boy's training-home
on Mount Lebanon. It had seemed best to
organize a meeting of the Society of Friends at Brummana,
so that he went in 1876 to assist in person the
accomplishment of these two designs.</p>

<p>He sailed alone to Liverpool, and then with Alfred
Lloyd Fox, who had accompanied him on his first
visit, and Henry Newman, proceeded to Beirut, and
thence to Brummana.</p>

<p>They rode on horseback up Lebanon, and not far
from Brummana beheld a most touching sight. The
children of the school stood at a bend in the road, each
carrying a bouquet of flowers, which they held aloft as
their aged benefactor approached, and all these <em>Syrian
maidens</em> together gave their greeting in English:
"Welcome, our dear friends!" This simple, sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
manifestation of affection deeply impressed the venerable
messenger of Christ and cheered his heart. It
was like the loving welcome from his own children
upon nearing his own home.</p>

<p>A winter of work was passed pleasantly at the mission
and among the natives. In company with Theophilus
Waldmeier, the American and English messengers
visited Rustin Pasha, the governor of Lebanon,
who not only received them courteously and gave them
much assistance, but has ever shown himself a good
friend of the Friends' mission.</p>

<p>Eli Jones has had the good fortune to win the favor
of those high in authority, and he has used well his
opportunities to impress the dignitaries of those lands.
On the way from Joppa to Jerusalem he was in the
same hotel with the governor of Palestine. The latter,
hearing that a missionary of the Society of Friends was
in the house, wished to see him. They met and talked
together as friends. The governor showed himself a
man of wide culture and liberal views, believing in the
elevation of woman as a potent means of civilization,
his own daughters being students of science and literature.
He had a clear conception of American civilization,
and understood the position and history of
Friends, showing much interest in their work at
Ramallah. As they parted he asked with much feeling
that his aged American friend would pray for him and
Palestine.</p>

<p>Again, in 1882, Eli Jones sailed for England on his
way to the Holy Land, to be present at the opening
of the girls' training-home and to obtain a legal transference
of the mission to the Society of Friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Charles M. Jones of Winthrop, Me., was his valuable
companion. They were met in Liverpool by
Alfred Fox, who, though not able to attend them on
this journey, went as far as Marseilles to see them
well on their way. They landed in Joppa, and soon
after their arrival were invited by the Episcopalian
clergyman to come to his house to meet and address
a little company. They found a large number
assembled, and Eli Jones was told that he might address
them in English, with the assurance of being
perfectly understood; so that here, in that ancient
city where Peter was taught to regard as clean all
cleansed by God, the walls of division were again
taken down and a minister of the Quakers preached
the gospel in the English language to an assembly of
Episcopalians.</p>

<p>On landing at Beirut they visited the American
school in that city, and were asked to address the
scholars, which they did. After the exercises were
over the lady in charge of the school, finding from
their conversation that they were Friends, said with
much surprise, "I thought you were Presbyterians."
They were warmly welcomed at the Mount Lebanon
Mission-school, and were occupied there and at the
Ramallah mission until the spring of 1883.</p>

<p>On their return, Alfred Fox stood on the wharf at
Marseilles to greet them. He did not leave them until
their steamer sailed from Liverpool, and there waved
them a long farewell. His death not long after removed
from this world a grand Christian gentleman,
the dearest friend of Eli Jones's later life.</p>

<p>The fourth journey of the latter to Palestine successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
accomplished, the faithful servant of God
returned to the familiar scenes of his own home, not
to seek the rest of one who puts the armor off, but to
spend the last years which God's goodness had given
him in declaring with the zeal of vigorous manhood
the business of soldiers commissioned by the Prince
of peace. Each year which puts its weight upon him
lessens the probability of his re-seeing Lebanon and
Jerusalem, but no spot except that which eighty years
have made almost sacred to him as home has so many
memories and attractions touching his heart. When
he went from home bowed with age to undertake his
last visit some one said, "I fear thou wilt never come
back to us." He replied, "Lebanon's top is as near
heaven as my native China is."</p>

<p>He has twice visited the missions in person, and each
time found work for three or four months. He has
always been greatly loved by those for whom the work
is being done. Being asked once the reason for his
success with these Arabs, he replied, "Because I am
of the people. I go down to their condition, but do
not stay there; I endeavor to bring them up." They
are very strong in their affections, and dislikes as well,
and they are exceedingly keen to see their real benefactors.
Eli Jones experiences his greatest pleasure
taking these children around him and teaching them
in his characteristic way, while they love him as a good
father. In the answers to his questions he was often
surprised by the originality of the little pupils. One
day as he was talking to a class of girls he asked where
the Jordan rises; immediately came the answer. Again,
"Where does it end?"&mdash;"In the Dead Sea." "And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
becomes of the water, as the Dead Sea has no outlet?"
There was a long silence, when a little Arab girl replied,
in a simple, beautiful metaphor, "The sun drinks
it up." On one occasion he found the children sitting
on the floor to be taught; he at once ordered seats
for the room, though he was told they would not use
them. He replied, "We will see; if you get them
from the floor upon good seats, you have raised them
so much from their low condition." When he next
went to the room he found them proudly sitting on
their new seats. One little girl who could speak English
came over by his side and said, "We thank you
for these seats." When he was about to come back
and to separate from them they stood round him with
tears in their eyes to wave him a farewell.</p>

<p>The questions are often asked, "Is the gain worth
the cost? Does the improvement correspond to the
outlay and effort?" There is but one answer. These
Druse boys and girls are eager to be taught, not only
to read and write, but to understand the story and
teachings of Christ. They go from the school entirely
different persons, and they are wholly unwilling
to go back to their unchristian manners of life. They
are capable of becoming good scholars, and many of
them are ready to teach others. The character of
the natives around Mount Lebanon has completely
changed, while those being trained are now in a condition
to exert an elevating influence on those about
them.</p>

<p>Mission-work, like all other work, must consent to
be tested by its fruits. The work of Friends on Lebanon
and at Ramallah will stand this test well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter to his friend S. F. T., Eli Jones writes to
express his feeling of loneliness without his wonted
companion, and the nature of the work being done in
the Holy Land at the time of his third visit there in
1876:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="head">
<span class="smcap">Brummana</span>, 1st mo. 8, 1876.
</p>

<p>While my fellow-travellers and Th. Waldmeier have
gone to a distant village to attend to matters of business,
I have been left to my own reflections, and I
have in an unusual manner missed the sympathy and
the words of cheer in times of trial that I was sure to
receive from her who has been called up higher before
me. Her words were as balm to my troubled breast,
but now I plod on alone. My life would be too sad
and weary to be borne did I not trust that an Eye
of compassion beholds me here even as when in my
native land surrounded by loved friends.</p>

<p>We left England on the 9th of 11th mo., and spent
several days in France attending ten meetings in that
country; then embarking at Marseilles for Alexandria,
where we spent a few days meeting old acquaintances
and attending to what seemed called for. Again we
went on board ship, and next day came to Port Said
at the mouth of the Suez Canal, the morning after we
were in Joppa. Here we visited the institution under
the instruction of Jane Arnot, a woman of <em>great faith</em>
and of <em>much works</em>, who has a school of sixty girls.
We found her occupying a new house erected on the
very spot where our tent was pitched a few years ago,
and where we had a meeting one First day afternoon
with the people of Joppa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>We reached Beirut the 31st of 12th mo., and the
next day came to Brummana, where we received a warm
welcome. Hanne Ferach, my little Bethlehem girl,
rushed forward and grasped the hand of her old
friend with the cordiality of a loving daughter; also
several of the citizens came to bid us welcome to
their town. All this was unexpected, and, to speak
honestly, it moved our hearts and was a delightful
ending of a long journey.</p>

<p>We are much pleased with the work begun here.
On First day our meeting frequently numbers over one
hundred, the Bible meeting in the middle of the week
over thirty.</p>

<p>In the room where I am setting a teachers' meeting
is going forward preparatory to the labors to-morrow,
which will be the first of the week. Sitting around
the table are ten preachers and teachers; two of these
are female. Their conversation is all Greek to me,
but it is very interesting to see them arming for their
work from such an armory.</p>

<p>The Sabbath-school numbers sixty, while there are
six schools in operation through the week, reaching at
least two hundred and thirty children; all these are
emphatically Bible-schools.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>AS A FRIEND.</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be ye complete in Him."</p>

<p>"God's own hand must lay the axe of inward crucifixion unsparingly
at the root of the natural life; God in Christ, operating in the person
of the Holy Ghost, must be the principle of inward inspiration <em>moment</em>
by <em>moment</em>, the crucifier of every wrong desire and purpose, the Author
of every right and holy purpose, the Light and Life of the
soul."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Upham.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>Eli Jones was a birthright member of the Society
of Friends, and as far back as there is any record the
family had been a Friends' family, so that he inherited
an inclination to the manners and views of the Society;
and it was as much expected of him that he would
make these views his own as it was that he would be a
worthy son of his parents and grandparents. Quakerism
was the air which a Friend's child breathed seventy-five
years ago, and it was a poor child that longed for
another atmosphere. It was a startling revelation to a
boy that there were people in the world who said <em>you</em>
to one person, and it required an explanation.</p>

<p>Eli had little opportunity of reading the lives of the
Friends of former times, and he had no way of finding
out the "philosophy of Quakerism," but his father
and mother and the whole circle of his connections
had a definite idea of what they believed, and their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
were more teaching than many books would have been.
The different meetings were regularly attended by the
young members, and they early became accustomed to
the ways of doing the necessary business. He learned
to respect the body which transacted its business so
quietly and orderly, and which had such a loving and
successful plan for reaching the state and standing of
the different members.</p>

<p>The monthly readings of the "Queries" placed each
soul in the silent confessional before its Lord, while
the general "Answers" gave opportunity for efficient
counsel. It was a living Church, and its light shone
before men. There were excellent examples of pure
Christian character in the Society at China&mdash;ministers,
elders, and members who would deeply impress the
young, who thought of no other course than following
in the steps of their predecessors. The quiet
strength and sweetness of the best members of the
Society, their guilelessness and sincerity, have had
great weight in holding young men, and have done
what austere teaching could never have done. The
call to confess Christ, as they proclaimed it, was also
a call to a higher manhood and nobler living.</p>

<p>Eli Jones early loved Friends, and his love has continually
augmented. He has done his work in the
Society, going out on his own various missions each
time with its sanction; and he has experienced fully
the help which comes from the united and loving support
of the Church at home. His life has been widely
useful in great measure because he was a Friend, for
the work he has done could properly have been done
only in Friends' way, and he could never have succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
under the restrictions of any other church
organization. He was qualified to be a Friend minister,
but he was not adapted to be one of any other denomination.</p>

<p>About forty years ago, as he was beginning to preach,
there appeared in New England a new phase of thought.
Its centre was at Concord, Mass., and its adherents were
called <em>Transcendentalists</em>. They held, among other
things, that to really know man must have something
in him which transcends human knowledge or the
knowledge of the senses. In order to know truth a light
must shine into man's mind from the Source of light,
and who ever would know himself, the world and the
Supreme Being must have a God-given teacher in his
own breast; but these men maintained that this was a
<em>natural</em> endowment of the human mind&mdash;a wonderful
gift, but given in the <em>same way</em> as memory. The difference
between Transcendentalism and Quakerism has
been thought slight; it is, however, immense. The
Society of Friends has never believed that man by
<em>nature</em> has any power or light within him capable of
satisfying his longings or of gaining salvation for his
soul. While Friends do not lose sight of the facts
that Christ the Son of God came to be a perfect
ensample for us; that He came to give us life, and
to give it more abundantly; that He is the Light
of the world; that the true follower of Christ should
strive to be Christ-like, to come up to "the full
stature of Christ;" and that there can be no compromise
with any sin, but a gradual growth in firm character,
high manliness, a daily striving for sincerity
and purity,&mdash;their great theme for the comfort of a lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
world has been that there is life in the acceptance of
Christ; that there is health through our abiding union
in Him, and thenceforth growth and development by
virtue of our oneness with Him whose blood cleanses
and whose Spirit quickens. Manliness and high morality,
necessary graces of the Christian, have been attainable
by all nations and all ages to a higher or lower
degree. "<em>Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners</em>,"
and all men of every degree are there included. Felt
necessary in all ages, foretold in types and by inspired
prophets, and heralded by messengers from heaven, at
length, in the fulness of time, the Saviour came. He
came not to bring a creed or bonds or forms: He came
to bring salvation, freedom, spirituality. He came to
publish a new kingdom, which could be entered only
through Him. He finished His work fully, and, about
to depart, He promised to "pray the Father, and he
shall give you another comforter (strengthener), that
He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of
truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth
Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him;
for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you;" having
said before, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;
and <em>greater works shall he do; because I go unto my
Father</em>;" "Howbeit, when the Spirit of truth is come,
He will guide you into all the truth;" "That was the
true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world." Whoever believes the truth of the gospel
record to its fullest extent, and actually accepts salvation
through Christ, becomes not only a better man,
but a new man; he will live henceforth not for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
world, but for that which is to come; he will conquer
and throw aside all his besetting sins; and he will be
a "living epistle" publishing the greatness of the good
news to all others: furthermore, no work for his Lord
will seem to be too great to be undertaken, for the
promise is, "greater things shall ye do; for I go unto
my Father."</p>

<p>Now, Eli Jones while a young man accepted his
Saviour and experienced this new birth, and, seeking
first the kingdom of God, he has not ceased to labor
for the greatest possible bettering of the world. This,
he believed, could be best done by spreading a knowledge
of Christ and by endeavoring to bring about a
literal fulfilment of His teaching. Christ, the source
of life, the source of light, and a perfect example to
be followed, has been his theme. Peace, total abstinence,
and high education came in course as proper
causes for him to uphold. He has always believed
in supreme guidance, and before undertaking work has
waited until the inward ear heard the voice, and so his
going forth has been blessed. His whole life testifies
that he has not deceived himself, and that he has not
worked for his own material gain. He has always
stood against formalism and spoken for spirituality,
and he has wished for life to so abound that formality
in any way could not exist. He has felt
that all Christ's devoted followers must in some way,
by life or voice, obey the command given to the
first apostles: "Go ye into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature;" and the message which
he has carried has always been, "Ye must be born
again." The equality of man and woman and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
equality of all men and all women, equality of worth
before the Creator, has made him earnest to gain for
woman her <em>real rights</em>, and he has felt the necessity
of raising in the social scale all who have been bound
down in any degree by the bonds of prejudice.</p>

<p>Points of doctrine have been little discussed by him,
for he has felt called to live and preach the gospel, the
same tidings which Paul went to Macedonia to declare&mdash;not
to discuss and argue in regard to questions which
can be settled only when we enter "the land which is
very far off." There are some things which must be
clearly fixed, great cardinal truths on which to be
wrong is to be wholly wrong; but a broad spiritual
interpretation of the whole Bible, by the aid of the
Holy Spirit, gives any seeking man enough teaching
on necessary points to guide him; and Eli Jones has
gladly received in addition all the help he could receive
from the <em>wisdom given</em> to other men and women,
such as fathers, counsellors, and elders.</p>

<p>Penn asked, "How shall I know that a man does
not obtrude his own sense upon us as the infallible
Spirit?" and he answers, "By the same Spirit." Whatever
is said contrary to the Scriptures, though the
guidance of the Spirit is professed, must be accounted
a delusion.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> No man regrets more than Eli Jones that
there are those who speak their own words as the truth
given to them, for words become lifeless whenever the
brain is allowed to speak for the Spirit, whenever any
one deceives himself and gives his own thoughts for
oracles; and he has felt that Friends, of all people,
should beware of self-love and self-will, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
individual members should ever be ready to receive
benefit from the counsel of others. Each human being
has a special field to till in the great vineyard. He who
has climbed a height is more than ever duty bound to
reach down hands of help to the weak. The gifts differ,
but it is every man's business to find out for what he
was sent, and then do the mission&mdash;do it "ever in the
great Taskmaster's eye;" do it for no reward, but for
the truth's sake; and He who sends the workmen into
the field will send the basket for their supply. Whether
doing quiet work at home or more extensive work
abroad, Eli Jones has had one mind&mdash;to obey orders;
and whenever he has been free to do temporal work
for his own support and for his aid in gospel work,
he has improved every opportunity, imitating the
example of the tentmaker, while Friends have generously
furnished the means for him to go out into
distant fields.</p>

<p>He has lived to see a decided change come over the
Society in his own section&mdash;a change almost universally
apparent. In his early manhood came the great separation
of the "Hicksites," and he felt keenly the want
of harmony in 1840-45, when John Wilber opposed
Joseph John Gurney; but he has ever hoped that the
small body of spiritually-minded Friends would hold
fast to their faith, maintaining harmony throughout,
and not provoking or exaggerating differences of
opinion. Most who grew old with him have passed
away, and some with the belief which saddened their
old age that the end of their Society was near. He
has continually&mdash;and never more than in his old age&mdash;believed
in the progress of humanity; he has seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
history and in his own life how one generation carries
on the truth rejected by the former one; and in his
thoughts faith and hope have been united. He trusts
that in God's plan there is endless progress, and until
something higher and purer and more perfect than
Friends' conception of Christ's work and teaching
appears the Society will be needed, and there will
not be wanting those who hold fast the excellent
spiritual truths of Quakerism, and a practical Christianity
lived out with daily circumspection in their
thoughts and words and deeds. He is impressed,
as were the founders of our Society, with the truth
that Christianity is both a faith and a corresponding
life. The words of his old age have been not less
acceptable and effective than those of his early manhood,
and he has not changed his message. The
earnestness with which he has pleaded for the essentials,
the liberality he has shown in regard to non-essentials,
and the rounded completeness of his life
have given him a wide influence and have made
him justly loved; but his strength has always been

<h3><em>HIS PLACE AS A WORKER.</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"Quit you like men."</p></blockquote>


<p>The people of a city or country in which is some
great natural wonder or some magnificent work of man
become so accustomed to its grandeur that only the
largest-minded of them continue to appreciate its excellence
and gain culture from it. This is not true of
men. A man who has the qualifications to instruct and
the power to inspire his deemsmen will have renewed
power, and will gain a stronger influence over all of
them, as age brings matured wisdom. Few greater
blessings can come to a community than to have a
strong man working like leaven in the midst of it, and
few posts of honor are more to be coveted than to be
a part of all that is best in one's environment.</p>

<p>Eli Jones has decidedly influenced his township, and
he has the satisfaction of feeling in his old age that he
is without enemies and in possession of a numerous
company of friends, the "uncle" of all who know
him. He has had the good fortune&mdash;or, better, the
good judgment&mdash;to know just what his place was.
He has done each duty, never wishing that he might
have found something greater to do, and now his services
combined into one whole make a record which
men of great fame often fail to gain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the best tests of a man's power is his influence
over the young. There is a time in early life
when there is a longing for real help, when a young
person feels groping in the dark for the right road,
which he wants, but cannot find. Eli Jones has been
at hand to throw, by his counsel and Christian advice,
light on the right path, and many a man and woman
stands to-day fixed firmly in a good place and on a
high road to a better because he spoke a good word
or reached out his hand when there was need of
just that word or encouragement.</p>

<p>His love of education and his fondness for books
have made themselves felt. He has been one of the
foremost in founding and sustaining two schools&mdash;"Oak
Grove Seminary" and the "Erskine High
School." The latter partly owed its existence to
him. He has started and built up a number of libraries,
and he has wished to leave coming sons and
daughters supplied with a fountain from which to
draw. Not a few of the college graduates who have
gone out from China received their first impulses to
higher aspirations from him, in one way or another.</p>

<p>In temperance work he has taken his part. He
began to speak for total abstinence as a boy, which
has been his theme ever since, and he took active part
in securing a majority for the Prohibition amendment
in the State of Maine.</p>

<p>For many years he was an active member of the
"Sons of Temperance," and as Grand Worthy Patriarch
of that organization he did much permanent
good in the State. In this work he was intimately
associated with Ex-Governor Sidney Perham, Neal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Dow, John Kimbal of Bangor, D. B. Randal, the
aged patriarch of the Methodist Church, and others
of the ablest advocates of the Maine law.</p>

<p>It was once a law of the State that the selectmen
of each town should appoint some suitable man to
fill his cellar with various liquors, and whose sole
right it should be to sell such articles. For one year
Eli Jones was appointed to act as liquor-agent for
the town. Strange picture, that of a well-known
Quaker minister and prominent advocate of total
abstinence holding the office of drink-dispenser to
his townsmen! It can be imagined with what feelings
the toper would enter his yard, make known
his desire, and what words of advice he would receive
instead of the foaming glass.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that no cellar was stored that
year, and during his term of office the community
abstained.</p>

<p>In 1852, at the time of his first visit to England and
Ireland, but few Friends in those countries had heartily
espoused the cause of total abstinence. Since that time
a great change has taken place. "To hail from Maine
is <em>now</em> no discredit to the visitor. <em>Then</em> a specimen
from Maine was looked upon with some distrust."</p>

<p>It will not be out of place to refer here to his connection
with the origin of the "United Kingdom Alliance."
Its essential declarations are as follows: "1.
That it is neither right nor politic for the state to afford
legal protection and sanction to any traffic or system
which tends to increase crime, to waste the national
resources, to corrupt the social habits, and to destroy
the health and lives of the people. 2. That the traffic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in intoxicating liquors, as common beverages, is inimical
to the true interests of individuals and destructive
of the order and welfare of society, and ought therefore
to be prohibited. 3. That the history and results
of all past legislation in regard to the liquor traffic
abundantly prove that it is impossible satisfactorily
to <em>limit</em> or <em>regulate</em> a system so essentially mischievous
in its tendencies.... 7. That, rising above class,
sectarian, or party considerations, all good citizens
should combine to procure an enactment prohibiting
the sale of intoxicating beverages, as affording most
efficient aid in removing the appalling evil of intemperance."</p>

<p>This was a union against intemperance on a most
uncompromising platform, and its work during the
last quarter of a century has been enormous. The
simple facts of Eli Jones's connection with this organization
are as follows: As he was returning from
Dublin yearly meeting to London he found himself
in company with Nathaniel Card, a Friend of Manchester,
England. Their conversation turned upon
temperance, for our friend had not been silent on
this subject during his stay in Ireland. Nathaniel
Card became much interested, and wished to take
an American temperance paper, as well as to have a
copy of the Maine prohibitory law. He was given
the address of Neal Dow, and a correspondence was
opened. About eighteen months after this conversation,
Eli Jones being in Manchester, three gentlemen
called on him. Nathaniel Card was one of
them, who as speaker said, "We are the officers of
the British and Foreign Temperance Alliance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
whatever results come from its formation <em>began</em> with
our conversation on our return journey from Ireland."</p>

<p>Many English Friends have been connected with
this organization, and Eli Jones had the opportunity
at the time of his later visits to England to attend
some of the meetings and to hear the beneficent results
of its far-reaching influence.</p>

<p>His work for the advancement of peace has been
lifelong. He has strained his eyes to catch glimpses
of a better era, in which the literal and spiritual teaching
of Christ shall be fulfilled in a universal brotherhood
of men and nations; and he has lived to see
already "a flood of prophesying light." When over
eighty years old he was sent as a delegate to the
Friends' Peace Conference at Richmond, Indiana, in
1887, and his voice was often heard discussing with
younger men and women the wisest course for binding
nations into families by bonds of love, so that
rust may dull the carnal weapons of war,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"And the cobweb be woven across the cannon's throat,</div>
<div class="line indent2">To shake its threaded tears in the wind."</div>
</div></div>

<p>He has always looked with joy on the advance of
the human race, and he has had uncompromising faith
in actual and triumphant progress. Nothing has made
his crowning years more bright than the thought, ever
present with him, that the good is gaining a gradual
ascendency, and that man's lot, already a happy one,
is becoming more happy. He has seen nations that
have sat in darkness rising to stand in the joy-bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
light, and he has trusted the future will bring mature
fruit. This buoyant hope has not only made his life
joyous, but has pervaded all the messages of his later
years, and he has shown that optimism which every
true Christian must feel, for his Master "doeth all
things well."</p>

<p>He felt called above everything else to preach the
gospel, but he was sent to preach not only from the
text which John the Baptist gave, but also he has
"spoken unto men to edification." He has held up
the perfect mark, the goal, "a life hid with Christ in
God." Every power of man, physical, moral, mental,
spiritual, is to be developed and expanded to its fullest
extent, and then brought into strict obedience to the
will of God. We are not in our place until we yield
the same obedience to the celestial laws that we yield
to the laws of gravitation. Character&mdash;which implies
integrity, purity, unselfishness, love, patience, self-forgetfulness,
and temperance&mdash;means the truth we have
received, made our own, and put in action. Hence
Eli Jones has spent his life telling all people to seek
first of all the kingdom of heaven, which is righteousness
and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost&mdash;to give
their whole lives and beings to the Lord, and to build
up pure Christian characters. The strength and manliness
of his life have made his messages weighty, and the
clearness of his thought, with his abundance of strong
English words forcibly arranged, has caused his speaking
on whatever subject to be effective. His speaking
has always been from the fulness of his heart and with
all the energy of his individuality. Never has he been
known to speak weakly or unemphatically. If he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
no message, he kept his seat, and if he rose to speak
it was because he had something which he deeply felt
and which it was important for those present to hear.</p>

<p>Of medium height, possessing a very large head,
penetrating, earnest eyes, and impressive in his movements,
his rising always gained him attention. His
voice, which in childhood had been imperfect, grew
clearer and more emphatic with use, and by constant
attention to careful enunciation he gained the power of
distinct expression to such a degree that after having
on one occasion found it necessary to speak continuously
in the Newport meeting-house for three hours,
he was told by those in the farthest galleries that not
a word had been lost. In his most earnest appeals he
is decidedly eloquent, and many there are who have
heard in his vigorous words that call which lifts souls
from dreamy thought to action. Not one of his sermons
has been put on paper, for he spoke as the words
came to his mouth, and reporters were not present;
but there was a clearness and connection as marked as
was the strength of the individual parts, so that his
utterances if printed would be highly valued. If those
men do us the greatest service who give us the clearest
view of our relation to God and our duty to man, then
we owe him gratitude, for he successfully helped feet
that were failing to find a surer foothold on the abiding
base of the Rock of Ages.</p>

<p>Further, he performed the true part of the citizen
of a democracy, the part of one who sees the brother
and sister mark on every forehead. Every person who
hopes and prays for the highest success of the principles
of our government will have moments of trial for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
his faith as he sees the multitudes of responsible citizens
who exercise their high privileges in town and State
moved by no higher thought than the accomplishment
of a selfish aim; he will feel a deeper gloom still when
he learns in how many hearts respect for pure men and
sacred principles and reverence for the Ruler of men
and nations have been obscured by the mists of party
schemes and personal self-love. Eli Jones as a Quaker
has clearly proclaimed the only basis on which a democracy
can build with a reasonable hope of a beautiful
and permanent structure. In a nation where every
man is a legislator, every man must</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Feel within himself the need</div>
<div class="line">Of loyalty to better than himself,</div>
<div class="line">That shall ennoble him with the <em>upward</em> look;"</div>
</div></div>

<p>nor can he be a safe sharer in the rights of government
who has not intimate converse with the Voice
which calls for an <em>inward</em> look. Through a life of
over eighty years he has sought to act at the ballot-box
so that the largest number of human beings might
feel the good effects of his vote.</p>

<p>Again, his life is an interesting example of continuous
development. Though beginning early to obey
the voice of duty in regard to public speaking, he had
reached nearly the age of forty before he was really at
work. Year after year since he has seen with clearer
vision, and, catching the teaching of the nautilus, he
has made</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Each new temple, nobler than the last,</div>
<div class="line">Shut him from heaven with a dome more vast,"</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>
<p>and, feeling more truly each year the serious business
of a denizen of earth, he has doubled his diligence to
quit himself like a man.</p>

<p>There has been a deep vein of humor running
through his whole life, and the genuine "mother
wit" often found in New Englanders has shown itself
in him to a marked degree. His answers to difficult
questions always come at once, and have a keenness
which goes to the marrow of the subject. Those who
have listened to his conversation and heard his illustrative
anecdotes need no example to call to their mind
his native humor, for it has continually shown itself.
The uniformity of his disposition should be spoken of.
Calm and equable under trying circumstances, he was
a strong support to his beloved wife when in feeble
health she seemed almost weighed down, and he was
especially fitted by this quality for the perplexing difficulties
which necessarily beset a laborer in foreign
lands.</p>

<p>His ripe years have been passed at the foot of China
Lake near his boyhood's home, and he has sat in the
meeting as a father in the midst of his family. Now
and then called forth for short service, he has loved to
hasten back and to be at home.</p>

<p>At the time I write he is still permitted to dwell
among us, and we are fortunate in having before our
eyes one who has the weight of many years of experience
and wisdom.</p>

<p>When riding with him around China Lake one lovely
summer day some of us younger members of the party
pointed out a church-spire in the distance, and asked
him if it was not a beautiful picture&mdash;the spire rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
from the abundant green of the surrounding trees and
pointing to the cloudless blue sky. Slowly he said,
"Yes, but it would be better if we knew that all who
sit there owned what is above the spire;" and we felt,
as we looked at his genial face lighted up as he
gazed aloft, that "his citizenship was in heaven" and
that "for him to die" would be "gain." There is a
domain on earth which only the true servant enters,
and there is a realm of which we do not speak definitely
that opens its gates to admit those who hear the
"Well done!" of the great Master. Blessed indeed is
he whose life has been a preparation for the city where
no sun is needed, but where the glory of God is the
light, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb.</p>
